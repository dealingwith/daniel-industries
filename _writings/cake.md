Cake is a band that has been lurking at the edge of the mainstream music world for many years now. Their second release, 1996’s _Fashion Nugget_, saw it’s single, _The Distance_ make significant headway on pop and alternative charts. Beyond that blip, however, Cake has failed to register on the pop radar. And that’s most likely a great thing. Their art has been about rebellion against the mainstream; it has had a political and social commentary to it that could never be easily digestible enough for common-man’s radio.

It is an arguable but widely-held view that Cake’s debut, 1994’s Motorcade of Generosity, is their most original in style, sound, and lyrics. Their weirdly catchy, wholly original melodies cause you to quickly find yourself drumming and singing along. While the dime-store acoustic guitar of lead singer John McCrea bangs out the basic track, poorly recorded drums provide some noise in there somewhere…but it is really the amazing melodies, the call-and-response chants, and the poetic lyrics which make the album soar. This is authenticity at its high-talent, low-budget best.

Originally financed by the band while they continued holding down their day jobs…perhaps this is the reason that John’s lyrics so honestly slam the consumerism and personal politics of American society while at other times delve inward and expose the alternately cynical and soft workings of his psyche.

The original Motorcade record was recorded at an 8-track home studio for $10 an hour. It was remastered in 1999.

It starts with _Comanche_, a simple yet profound comment on society’s pressures to be perfect:

> yeah, come comanche, comanche, comanche, commode.  
> yeah, if you want to have cities, you've got to build roads.  
> you need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut.  
> you need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.

That thread continues with a bizarre satanic theme (the use of Christian/satanic good/evil light/darkness ideas will become common) of _Pentagram:_

> Your pentagram is down below our floor.  
> Your naked body shimmers in the night.  
> Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.  
> Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies,  
> Who have passed the test just like all the rest,  
> But never really understood the reasons why  
> They took it in the first place.

Followed up with a sharp critique of our hypocritically Christian culture which balances both irony and self-revelation in _Jesus Wrote a Blank Check:_

> Jesus wrote a blank check,  
> One I haven't cashed quite yet.  
> I hope I've got a little more time.  
> I hope it's not the end of the line.  
> Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check.  
> One I haven't cashed yet, all right.  
> But if I had to choose a number,  
> I'd want it to be number one.  
> I don't want to be number two.  
> Yeah, I don't want to be number four.  
> But I can hear a knock on the door.  
> Jesus wrote a blank check, all right.

And of course the anthemic anti-consumerist classic, _Rock n Roll Lifestyle:_

> Well, your CD collection looks shiny and costly.  
> How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzi?  
> And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?  
> Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?  
>   
> Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs,  
> Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.  
> And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t-shirt  
> That proves you were there,  
> That you heard of them first?  
>   
> How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
> How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
> How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
> Ah, tell me.  
>   
> How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar,  
> The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?  
> And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar,  
> One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another   show?
> And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
> As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
> And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
> As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
>   
> Excess ain't rebellion.  
> You're drinking what they're selling.  
> Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.  
> Your chaos won't convert them.  
> They're so happy to rebuild it.  
> You'll never really kill it.  
> Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.  
> You're drinking what they're selling.  
> Excess ain't rebellion.  
> You're drinking,  
> You're drinking,  
> You're drinking what they're selling.

You can almost see the video here: the masses in their red, white, and blue uniforms hold up cans of soda while chanting “How do you afford your rock’n’roll lifestye?” over and over, the intentionally ironic nods to Pink Floyd, McCrea as some Bill Gates of popular culture, ruling over the throngs of thoughtless buyers. But alas, there were no videos back then. Cake was barely surviving the 200+ concert dates a year in some ratty van. Health insurance was still out of reach.

> Right now, so many things are absolutely ludicrous, and absolutely tragic.

> -- John McCrea

> Nobody would dare come up to me and give me shit in this town because everybody knows I'm an asshole. I would have something to say in response. I don't necessarily celebrate my celebrity, and that makes me less vulnerable than someone who does. I don't get off on it. In fact, it bugs me.

> -- John McCrea


Then came along _Fashion Nugget_. Was this the beginning of the end for Cake? The song _The Distance_ became a theme for frat boys and jocks the nation over. At a concert in Tucson, Arizona, sometime after the single’s explosion, McCrea said before they played it, “After this, all of you who came to hear one song can go home.” They were definitely propped for one-hit wonderland.

Socially and consciously, however, the band was still at the same level. Take _Frank Sinatra:_

> Beyond the suns that guard this roost  
> Beyond your flowers of flaming truth  
> Beyond your latest ad campaigns  
> An old man sits collecting stamps  
> In a room all filled with Chinese lamps  
> He saves what others throw away  
> He says that he'll be rich someday

Or _Nugget:_

> Heads of state who ride and wrangle  
> Who look at your face from more than one angle  
> Can cut you from their bloated budgets  
> Like sharpening knives through Chicken McNuggets...  
> Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers  
> Will eat your children and steel your thunder  
> While heavy torsos that heave and hurl  
> Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels

<aside>
1996’s Fashion Nugget sold 1.2 million copies, thanks to the single The Distance, a song which was turned into a jock anthem. When the Indianapolis 500 wanted to license the song, Cake said no.
</aside>

And how _The Distance_ was turned 180 by the listening public is beyond me, especially given the biting nature of the first lines:

> Reluctantly crouched at the starting line  
> Engines pumping and thumping in time  
> The green light flashes, the flags go up  
> Churning and burning they yearn for the cup  
> They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank  
> Fuels burning fast on an empty tank  
> Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns  
> Their prowess is potent and secretly stern  
> As they speed through the finish, the flags go down  
> The fans get up and they get out of town  
> The arena is empty except for one man  
> Still driving and striving as fast as he can

Before the recording of _Prolonging the Magic_, bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown left the band. McCrea recorded the bass parts and recruited a number of Sacramento guitarists to participate in the _Prolonging_ sessions.
</aside>

The fame might have dulled the band a bit, however, and after the departure of the guitarist and bassist, McCrea really took the reigns of the band once and for all. He decided he didn’t want to be pigeonholed as the ironic anti-hero and toned down the words while he popped up the music. Even so, his personality still came through and the sound of Cake continued on relatively intact through 1998’s _Prolonging the Magic_. The opening track, _Satan is My Motor_, is both a brutal self-disclosure and an attack on hypocrisy:

> my intentions are good and earnest and true  
> but under my hood is internal combustion power  
> Satan is my motor

There was, however, something else happening. _Hem of Your Garment_ is a graceless tome that practically cries as you read it:

> i am intrinsically no good  
> i have a heart that's made of wood  
> i am only biding time  
> only reciting memorized lines  
> and i'm not fit to touch  
> the hem of your garment  
> no, no i'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment

The fire, confidence, and conscience that had guided the earlier two recordings is gone. Strangely, some of the tunes on this record were written during the same time as those on earlier records and simply remained in McCrea’s large backlog until _Prolonging_. Was this intentional in order to create these differing moods album to album or was it just a natural occurrence?

And so we come to the final record of this retrospective, their latest, _Comfort Eagle_. The “new” sound, if it could really be called that, has solidified, incorporating the quirky characteristics that make Cake Cake--the group shouts, the hand claps, the unique and abused percussion choices, the trumpet--into a slightly more musically sweet concoction. This time, however, we sometimes never know if McCrea is singing about some mythical instrument of social injustice (in this case, _Commissioning A Symphony In C_, the music industry), or just himself:

> You're sitting there thinking your thoughts  
> They are not about what is but what is not  
> You are sitting there breathing in your breath  
> You are seldom breathing life but mostly death

By this time, guitarist Xan McCurdy was around to do the electric guitar parts, although McCrea still handled the bass lines. He also directed both singles’ videos, the passersby comments video for _Short Skirt/Long Jacket_ and the Iron Chef takeoff (featuring two Cake band members actually cooking) for _Love You Madly_. Both can be seen on MTV but get heavy rotation on MuchMusic. The fact that Rick James is in the _Madly_ video and there is a song on this record called _Meanwhile, Rick James_ is definitely not a coincidence.

> I'd rather just get played on college radio and public radio and have a small number of people understand what we're doing, who come to our shows and appreciate what we think is worth appreciating; but there is no middle ground--it's like you have to have the big dumb rock experience or you don't have health care.

> -- John McCrea

> I will listen to a song even if it's not by the right band if I like the way the sound waves affect my ears. I don't see rebellion in a luxury culture like music as anything other than a Coke versus Pepsi dynamic. Listen to what you like. You have to be precocious if you like music.

It seems that at many times, the plight of the uninsured, struggling artist in a Central Valley town has been quieted by the constant rumoring about girls and cars. The symbolism is not so much Babelic as it is phallic.

Somehow, though, one can still hear the struggling soul somewhere deep beneath the hardened veneer. Maybe someday the demons of the music industry and the “adoring” public will leave John McCrea and Cake. In the meantime, Cake, like all of us, will struggle in the fight for love and honesty; and every once and a while, he’ll prophesy for us…

_Love You Madly_

> I don't want to fake it  
> I just want to make it  
> The ornaments look pretty  
> But they're pulling down the branches  
> Of the Tree

_Pretty Pink Ribbon_

> Without the pretty pink ribbon  
> You'd end up just like me  
> Without the pretty pink ribbon  
> You'd burn all these dying leaves  
> Your muscles would bulge underground  
> Your demons would all be around  
> Without the pretty pink ribbon  
> You'd end up just like me

_Comfort Eagle_

> We are building a religion  
> We are building it bigger  
> We are widening the corridors  
> And adding more lanes  
>   
> We are building a religion  
> A limited edition  
> We are now accepting callers  
> for the pendant key chains  
>   
> To resist it is useless  
> It is useless to resist it  
> His cigarette is burning  
> But he never seems to ash  
> He is grooming his poodle  
> He is living comfort eagle  
> You can meet at his location  
> But you better come with cash  
> Now his hat is on backwards

> You can dress up like a sultan
