## Foreclosure of the Name-of-the-Father and Psychosis

One recurrent Lacanian interpretation frames Donald Trump in terms of foreclosure – the exclusion of a fundamental signifier (the “Name-of-the-Father”) from the symbolic order – which, in Lacanian theory, precipitates psychosis[^1]. Commentators note Trump’s apparent “break” with consensus reality (endless false claims, conspiracy theories, personal “truth”) and liken this to a foreclosed symbolic Law in his psyche. In a 2018 analysis, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton observed that while Trump may not have clinical delusions or hallucinations, he subjects the public to “his own solipsistic reality”, essentially attempting to destroy our shared basis for reality[^2].

Lacanians extend this further: when the symbolic framework disintegrates, the result is a kind of normalized psychosis. As one Lacanian writer explains, “the normalization of psychosis, what Miller calls ‘generalized foreclosure,’ is a result of our common social frame and belief system [becoming] fragile. There is no longer a general Oedipal frame, with the Name-of-the-Father, that secures [a] shared system”[^3].

Trump’s rise is often seen as symptomatic of this decline of symbolic authority. For example, Slavoj Žižek’s circle describes Trump as an “obscene charismatic leader” who “takes himself, with all his personal quirks, as a direct embodiment of the big Other”, ruling by sheer will (“It is so because I say so”) rather than by any respect for knowledge or the existing symbolic order[^4]. In Žižek’s terms, the “repressed Master” (the dignified symbolic authority figure) has returned in an “almost psychotic form, as a lawless obscene Master” with Trump.

In other words, Trump personifies a breakdown of the symbolic Order – he recognizes no paternal limit or normative truth beyond his own claims, a stance Lacan equates with psychotic structure when taken to the extreme.

Some theorists even connect Trump’s constant resort to conspiracy (e.g. the “deep state” narrative) to a paranoid psychosis: he posits an all-powerful persecutory Other behind the scenes, which mirrors the classic structure of paranoia[^5]. In Lacanian terms, when the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed and the symbolic fails, the subject may fabricate a delusional world to patch over the hole in the symbolic – and Trump’s alternate reality of “fraudulent elections” and “fake news” can be seen as exactly such a “delusional patch” holding his world together.

As one scholar put it, “the figure of Trump…has become what Lacan calls a point de capiton (quilting point), where signified and signifier are knotted together”, anchoring a whole field of discourse[^6]. The danger, however, is that this personal fantasy is imposed on the social realm. Carl Raschke, in Continental Thought & Theory, argues that Trump’s presidency turned politics into a “gargantuan shared version of what psychoanalysis classically has termed an ‘obsessional neurosis’” – a collective symptom in which an incompatible truth is ardently denied and split off[^7].

If the chain of meaning slips entirely, Raschke warns (citing Lacan’s Seminar III), “the ongoing ‘sense’ generated in the chain of differential signs” can skid out of control; “the danger of this ‘unchained’ process, according to Lacan, is always psychosis – and that applies collectively as well”[^8].

## The Obscene Master: Perversion and the Law

Not all Lacanians agree that Trump is “psychotic” in the clinical sense. Another influential line of analysis portrays him as a perverse figure—a subject who knows the law and the difference between truth and falsehood, but flouts them knowingly to derive enjoyment and power.

Rhetorical scholar Joshua Gunn contends that “Lacan’s understanding of perversion better captures Trump’s peculiar brand of political rhetoric”[^9]. In Lacanian theory, perversion is a structure in which the subject situates themselves as an exception to the law or as the instrument of the Other’s jouissance (enjoyment). Applied to Trump, this means that Trump does not simply lack a sense of rules (as a psychotic would); rather, he recognizes social norms and violates them anyway, reveling in the transgression.

Gunn and others point to Trump’s “constant disavowals, his reliance on […] occultation, his transgressions, [and] his denial of consensus reality” – all of which are “underwritten by a perverse form of enjoyment that frees his supporters from legal, rhetorical, and psychic strictures”[^10].

In other words, Trump’s outrageous conduct (insults, lies, profanities) is intentional rule-breaking that sends a message to his audience: you too can ignore the supposed “Law” and indulge in forbidden enjoyment. Slavoj Žižek and others describe this dynamic in terms of the superego enjoyment. Whereas a traditional authority figure at least pretends to embody moral ideals, Trump serves up what Jacques Lacan called the “obscene superego” underside of authority. He says the unspeakable and does the prohibited, effectively encouraging others to indulge their aggressive drives under his protective charisma.

This obscene Master enjoys his quirks and cruelties openly, and that itself becomes the source of his authority. In Lacanian terms, Trump performs the role of the Father of Enjoyment rather than the Father of Law.

## Trump as Fetish and Object of Jouissance

Beyond formal diagnostic structures, Lacanian philosophers in Žižek’s orbit have speculated on the fantasmatic role Trump plays for himself and his supporters. Žižek himself has provocatively suggested that “Trump is now elevated to the status of a fetish in the psychoanalytic sense of the term”[^11].

In Freud and Lacan, a fetish is an object that stands in for a missing element, allowing the subject to disavow a traumatic truth (“I know this object is not the Thing I lost, but I treat it as if it is”). By calling Trump a fetish, Žižek implies that Trump functions as a screen for his followers’ anxieties and desires. They may unconsciously recognize the “absence” (the failings of the system, the lack in their own situation), but attach their hopes to Trump as a miraculous exception, thereby disavowing reality.

Žižek argues that this fetishistic devotion is key to understanding the passionate loyalty Trump commands – it’s not about facts, but about sustaining an illusion that Trump uniquely embodies their enjoyment or salvation[^11].

Psychoanalytic writer Cindy Zeiher, in “Trump, Our Favourite Jouissance”, examines how both supporters and opponents derive libidinal satisfaction from Trump[^12]. She notes the irony that liberals “enjoy calling him stupid” just as his base enjoys chanting their support – in either case, Trump is the object that incites enjoyment (whether through hate-watching or adulation).

Each significant Lacanian reading of Trump highlights a different aspect of this phenomenon: foreclosure and a psychotic break from reality; perversion and the law-defying enjoyment of transgression; and fetishistic devotion tied to collective jouissance.
