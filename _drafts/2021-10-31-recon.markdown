Last month I had the pleasure of attending the [RECON21](https://thekimmellfdn.com/recon21/) leadership conference. The conference is put on by [The Kimmell Foundation for Recovering Leadership](https://thekimmellfdn.com/), an organization that bears my grandfather's name and is dedicated to promoting "a value culture based on the core belief that people are intrinsically valuable."

> Our VISION is a world where people know they are valued, where their lives are improved daily in the workplace, where organizations thrive through empowered employees, and where people awaken to the significance of valuing each other and practice this principle in all their affairs.

The conference was a single-day, single-track conference with five speakers and a speaker panel. There were about 100 attendees. There was also an acapella group to entertain us between speakers.

At this point in my conference-attending career, I can afford to be picky, and that means only single-track conferences. They are far superior to their multi-track bretheren.

> It’s simple: selfish people make terrible leaders; other-oriented people make great leaders. It is our response to the inevitable suffering and resistance we experience in life that develops the character that determines the quality of our leadership. It is the quality of our leadership that determines the culture of our organizations. It is the culture of our organizations that determines the quality of the lives of the people we lead.

> As a leader, I cannot live my best life if the people I serve aren’t living theirs. Suffering in my life has the potential to produce in me the character necessary to lead well. Suffering is the substance of life, mine and the people I lead. The next time I find myself suffering, I want to be able to say, “What will I gain from this that I can give to those around me?” It is in this way that the inevitable difficulties in my life are redeemed, and it is The Kimray Way.
