I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: you still have chaos in yourselves.  

Alas, the time is coming when man will no longer give birth to a star. Alas, the time of the most despicable man is coming, he that is no longer able to despise himself. Behold, I show you the last man.  

'What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?' thus asks the last man, and blinks.  

The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. His race is as ineradicable as the flea; the last man lives longest.  

'We have invented happiness,' say the last men, and they blink. They have left the regions where it was hard to live...
