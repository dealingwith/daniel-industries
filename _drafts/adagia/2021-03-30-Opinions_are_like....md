"Strong opinions, loosely held," is held up in various circles as admirable. I'm starting to wonder. It beats "Loose opinions, strongly held," for sure, but what about just having fewer opinions that need to be held in the first place?

It seems like opinions--and, in particular, the need to express them, or at least hold them as important--fall into the broader category of identity formation. Opinions help us paint the picture of who we are, they position us within our tribe and position our tribe within the broader society. If we just have loose opinions, loosely held, are we just wishy-washy? Do we "not stand for anything"? Or are we just pacifists in a world obsessed with war?

I'm reminded of the scene so well depicted in&nbsp;_Jesus Christ Superstar:_

> _"_We all know that you are news--but are you king? King of the Jews?"

>

> "That's what you say."

>

> "What do you mean by that? That is not an answer."

Sometimes I wonder if disinformation isn't the greatest sin of the modern web, but rather simply the way it enables us to share our opinions within communities in which we are not really connected. We're all street-corner preachers, we all wear our own version of Westboro sandwich boards. We're all desperate to figure out how to place ourselves within the contexts in which we find ourselves...or perish.

But, well, that's just, like, my opinion, man.
