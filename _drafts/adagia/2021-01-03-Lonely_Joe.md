Joe lived alone in an apartment in a part of the city where mostly young people lived. "30,000-dollar millionaires", as they were referred to. Joe was not young. He was not a millionaire. He barely made more than 30,000 dollars.

Joe divorced 8 years ago. He wanted more. She deserved more.

Things did not go as planned afterward. Joe's loneliness came off of him like the stink of his cat's litterbox. It repelled all the women he wanted and attracted all those he didn't.

He drank more and more. First at bars, sat at the end of the bar. Then at home, flipping through Netflix shows, scanning the foreign films category for stuff that looked like it had a lot of sex.

His apartment was at the end of the building and his tiny patio looked down at the alley. He would sit on it and smoke half a pack of cigarettes at a time.

He read Nietzsche. He read manga.

He programmed incredibly niche single-serving applications late into the night and published them as torrents. A keylogger that would save every word over twenty characters to a text file. Browser extensions that did things that prevented them from being published on extension directories, like scrape porn sites or mine bitcoin.&nbsp;
