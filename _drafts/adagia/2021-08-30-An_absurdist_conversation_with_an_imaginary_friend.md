"I don't know how you are able to work in healthcare. I break out into existential crisis when I pass a homeless person on the sidewalk."

"You get used to it."

"Is it because you are that much more put together, or that much more fucked in the head?"

"There's a reason there are a lot of addicts in my field."

"Speaking of going crazy, I can't wait for it to cool off again."

"Got a couple of months still to go. Every year in October I think, 'Isn't it _over_ yet?!'"

"Yeah."

"As long as we don't have another crazy winter storm like last year. I don't like crazy variables. So many broken bones that week, and in the middle of a pandemic. And I didn't have power at home so I basically lived at the hospital."

"Where did your dog go?"

"Stayed with her grandmother."

"Who's that?"

"My mom."

"You call your mom your dog's grandmother?"

"Yeah, of course. Who else would be her grandmother?"

"I don't know, maybe the dog who is actually her mother's mother?!"

"Yeah, but I have no idea who that is. I got her at the SPCA."

"How's your mom feel about being a grandmother already?"

"Already? She's almost 60 years old!"

"What's the average age of a first-time grandparent? Hang on. Hey Google, what's the average age of a first-time grandparent."

_While some first-time grandparents are as young as 38, the average age of a first-time grandparent is 50._

"Wow. That's younger than I would have guessed."
