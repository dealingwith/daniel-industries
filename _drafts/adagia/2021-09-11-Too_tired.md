I feel like I'm in a fugue state but it's just that I'm utterly exhausted. I need to go to sleep. I need to take my pills tomorrow. I've skipped two days and it's like my brain is unable to create the chemicals necessary for life anymore. I hate that. I've also ridden my bike at \< 6am for the last few days. Last night I had one final burst of energy and worked from 10-12. Today has been a struggle after mid-morning.

One more very early ride tomorrow. Hopefully I can drag myself out of bed and get to the coffee in time to feel alive for one quick lap of the lake which is approximately 15 miles. Then pills.&nbsp;

(I can't take my pills this late at night because while they don't prevent me from sleeping the dreams they induce are disturbing.) :P

I always try to write at least 200 words on here and this is a sorry excuse for writing but I just didn't want to break my streak. Now I'm going to drag myself the 20 or so feet from my desk to my bed with a very quick break to brush my toofers.

196 words.
