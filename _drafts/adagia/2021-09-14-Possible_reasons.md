Possible reasons that seemingly everyone (we'll refer to them with the royal "you") on a call in the conference room next to my office at the coworking space talks extremely loudly:

1. You are old enough to have started doing conference calls in the 80s or 90s when microphone and speaker technology was not as advanced as it is today, and you trained yourself to speak very loudly into the little speakerphone in the center of the conference room so that the people on the other side of the phone in Ohio could hear you the first time. Now the people in Ohio are grasping for the volume down buttons on their laptops.
2. You think so highly of what you are saying that you must make it known in your loudest non-shouting voice possible, which is nearly shouting.
3. You think so poorly of what you are saying that you make it known in your loudest non-shouting voice to cover up the fact that you are in fact an imposter full of fear that you will be discovered at any moment.
4. You are hard of hearing and do not know it yet. Blame the Muse concerts and the raves. Coachella killed your cochlea.
5. You have a cucumber up your butt.
