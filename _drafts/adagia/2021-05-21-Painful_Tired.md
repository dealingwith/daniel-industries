I wrote the song [Painful Tired](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/painful-tired) approximately two decades ago and I still have issues with sleep that leave my body physically aching. (This morning I feel physically ill after sleeping terribly last night, following a week of sleep deprivation.) The song describes a correlation between the external pressures of society and the conditions that lead to those sleep issues. Revisiting the song this morning I realized that I still have the same observations, the same unanswered questions.

_So much, still so very little

What can we say to make it better?

I want to take the past away

I want to live for some better day

Painful tired, restless sleep

Rootless pain, painful tired

Urgent overdrive

Becoming so wise

Bearing an existence

Getting_ [_cut for size_](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/be-cut-to-size)

_Why this way?

Why so_

[_dashing_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dashing)_?

Why must it be_ [_questions after stabbing_](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/shoot+first%2C+ask+questions+later)_?_

[Chorus]

[Amazing guitar solo by John Lefler]

[Chorus]

The song is the only song I've released that is in an odd time signature (out of only a few that I've ever written in an odd time). I'd like to think that I subconsciously chose the odd time to intensify the off-kilter feelings expressed in the lyrics. I was intentional about the rhyming scheme (A B, C C in the first verse, A B C B in the 2nd and 3rd). I'm still pretty happy with the (hopefully evocative) connection between "cut for size"--"dashing"--"stabbing".&nbsp;
