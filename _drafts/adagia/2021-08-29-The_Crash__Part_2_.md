_...didn't want to leave anyone hanging..._

[[The Crash (Part 1)](https://adagia.org/content/2546)]

Bob arrived fifteen minutes late at the plant where he worked, and where he hoped to be presently promoted. When he opened the large glass doors to enter the management offices of the plant, he felt larger than life. He walked quickly down the long, carpeted hallways, looking all around at the white, blank walls. He stopped in front of a wooden door near the very end of the hallway. He straightened his tie and knocked on the door. After hearing the short reply from within, he opened the door and entered.&nbsp;

The room was large and rectangular in shape, with an almost haunting effect. It was made up almost entirely of dark wood. Bookshelves filled with assorted writings covered the three walls in front, behind, and to the right of Bob. Far to the left of the room was a large, wooden desk in front of a large window that made up a considerable amount of the wall. Behind the desk sat a short, white man who was very close to being bald. He had his elbows on the desk and held his head up by his thumbs, with the rest of his fists covering his mouth. Bob apprehensively approached the desk and the man behind it motioned him to sit down. The man put his hands on the desk, sighed, and spoke.

"Mr. Machinski, you probably know what I am going to say." The man sat up straight and sighed again as if he were struggling with the words. "Your promotion has been cleared. Congratulations." He stood and extended his hand. Bob quickly stood and shook it. He had a large smile on his face. His boss had a large frown on his. He continued, "I assume that you already know the responsibilities of floor supervisor. We also have a new plant manager, a transfer from the city plant. He is one of the most respected managers in the company. Good luck." They shook hands once again and Bob left the office.

The walk from the office to the plant was one of the shortest walks of Bob's life. He entered his new place of work. The small white room, filled with a variety of electronic equipment, had a large plexiglass window that overlooked the main room of the plant. Bob felt like a warlord standing on a high precipice, ruling from what used to seem like a heavenly position. He looked down at the man who faithfully carried out the duties that Bob was once required to do. The man scurrying around the various machines, clipboard in hand, looked very small to Bob. He could not believe that just yesterday that man was he.

Just at that moment of contemplation, the door opened and a hush came over the room. Everyone turned to look at the man who stood ominously in the doorway. Bob was the last to look, turning confidently to see who was entering the control room. He immediately recognized the brown hair and eyes. The man walked straight toward him. He shook Bob's hand and looked at him with an evil grin. "Hello there. Bob Machinski, I presume? I am Richard Smith, your new plant manager. I will be looking over your operation specifically this week." Suddenly Bob felt as small as an ant. It was the man whom Bob had so unintentionally met that morning.
