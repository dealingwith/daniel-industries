Bo was so tired of hearing scientists talk on the news. He wasn't sure why he kept watching it. Anyone could see he kept watching it because he enjoyed being angry. "Enjoyed" might not be the right word. "Needed to be" would be more accurate.

These people and their agendas. "Follow the damn money!" Bo would shout at the screen, at which moment he would remember he forgot to log out of his bank's app on his phone. "Dammit!" he would say to nobody as he felt in his pocket for his phone. "DAMN IT!" he would shout when he realized it wasn't in his pocket and he was forced to shove his hand down between the couch cushions to find it.&nbsp;

After logging out of his bank's app, he placed it on the coffee table, grabbed another handful of fries, and changed the channel. Channel, channel, channel, channel, channel, football. "Football!" Bo exclaimed with relief. Then he realized they were discussing the famous quarterback who was being sued. "Cancel culture!" Bo shouted at the TV and changed the channel. Channel, channel, channel, channel, porn. Bo ate another handful of fries. God DAMN french fries were delicious.
