Today was an incredible edition of the Paris Roubaix bike race. Even if you're not into bike racing you should go look at some of the photos from today, just for the shock value.

I rode this morning, felt pretty poorly, got home and watched the last 90 minutes of the race.&nbsp;

Then after some time with my kids, I went to a bike shop to see if they had bikes in my size. Miraculously, they did. I've been to so many bike shops IRL and online and no one has bikes. Two days ago I finally decided on a hand built steel frame and emailed the builder to see what his lead time is. He got back to me this morning: 1.5 years.&nbsp;

So then I was basically on to whatever bike I can get my hands on that meets my needs regardless of brand or material. I had never been to this particular shop before and they really surprised me with their stock and their service. I might get a bike after all.&nbsp;
