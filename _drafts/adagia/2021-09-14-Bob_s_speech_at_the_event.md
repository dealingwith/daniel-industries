This new product is incredible. It comes in five amazing new colors: our name for red, our name for blue, our name for metallic, our name for green, our name for pink. It's slightly different from last year's model in these stunning ways: it's 2mm wider, this piece of it that annoyed you is 1mm smaller, its edges are more squared off than before, the part of it that lets you take photos will take better photos in imperceptible ways, and you'll be able to store more of those photos on the product itself, although as always there is no way to get those photos off the device except via our internet servers, which you have to pay us to store things on.

You want this new product. Listen to the way I talk about it. This product will save you from your mundane existence with last year's product. Can't you tell by the tone of my voice? I'm already experiencing life with this new product. That's why I talk like this. I am enlightened.

Look around you. Imagine life with this product. Imagine how much more pleasant and seamless life will be with this product, as opposed to the previous product version. With this product, your friends and family are all smiling. There's no pain. No arguments.&nbsp;

You won't drop this product and crack the screen like you did with all the previous products you've owned.&nbsp;This product's battery will continue operating even after you forget to charge it overnight, we promise. At least for the first few months.
