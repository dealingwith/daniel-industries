Harry loved movies with good villains. He really loved movies with supervillains. He wished he could invent machines of destruction or some kind of mutative agent that would endow him with powers with which he could inflict harm on society.

Harry believed that there was an inverse to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. At the base of Harry's hierarchy was hunger, thirst, homelessness. Above that was fear. Above that were hate and abuse. Above that was just everyone feeling like they were a piece of shit. Above that was total chaos and destruction, within which Harry imagined himself rising to power, able to dominate his fellow humankind with an iron fist. Preferably a literal iron fist.&nbsp;

Harry didn't have many friends, as you might imagine. Even the guys down at the shooting range only tolerated him. He would get angry when they would refuse to put pictures of the actors he hated most downrange as targets.&nbsp;

The irony of Harry's reverse Maslow was he didn't realize he was not the master of it but rather traversing it himself, sliding down from the top to the bottom. His thirst for chaos and power made him feel like a piece of shit. He was filled with hate and spewed abuse because he felt like a piece of shit. He was afraid of everything he hated, which was almost everything. And he was on the verge of homelessness because, despite being confident he deserved as much wealth as Jeff Bezos, he could barely hold down a job.&nbsp;
