Alexander didn't attend art school to be a great artist. He wanted to be a famous artist. If that meant being great, so be it. If that meant being a flaming pile of elephant shit that got people excited and whipping their wallets out faster than an Instagram ad, then so be that.

Alexander didn't get an MBA to help businesses with their bottom line, or their cultures, or their operational excellence, or their marketing prowess, none of that nonsense. He got his MBA to be a famous writer and speaker and make the New York Times bestseller list and crack six figures per appearance.

Alexander wanted to be a cult of personality, a dictator of fashions, a movie star, a rock star, a _FÃ¼hrer_. He'd heard once that there was a level of multi-millionairism where a coke habit becomes mandatory. He wanted to find that level.

Alexander dreams of a life he's ashamed of. He doesn't care about happiness. He wants all the things others want because they think they will make them happy, but he knows they won't. He wants them anyway. He wants to sit lonely in his mansion surrounded by men and women and objects and comforts. He wants to feel a vacuous void in his soul and continuously fill it with things and people and experiences, never finding anything filling enough.
