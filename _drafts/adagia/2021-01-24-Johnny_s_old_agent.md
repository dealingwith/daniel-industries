New York City is the superior city in the world. I've been to many cities but -- and I know I'm biased because I've chosen to live here -- NYC is the best. Thank God my apartment is rent-controlled, though.

I'm getting a little long in the tooth. I've been in this industry for over 30 years and I got a late start. I knew how to pick 'em, though, and those early years working my butt off have paid off in the end.

But a lot of my clients are also getting long in the tooth. They don't so much retire as just slow down their rate of production to an imperceptible crawl.

I've never flown first class. Business-class for a while there, but recently I went back to coach. I never know when some of my regular checks are going to dry up.

Used to be I would have a briefcase jammed with just two scripts for a cross-country flight like this one. Now I have my precious iPad. Every script from the last ten years is sitting on this thing, and a good couple of handfuls yet to read. Not all of them from clients, or even potential clients. People know I will actually read their scripts and give them the honest truth if they ask me to. No commitment required, not even a meeting. I'm good like that.
