I like my job. This hotel is the oldest hotel in town, even if this hotel bar isn't the oldest bar in town. It's a nice town, in a big city, nestled in the foothills of the mountains. I've served a lot of famous people. A lot of business has been done over the drinks I've poured.

I mix fewer drinks than you'd think. Most people just want a wine, or a beer, or something on the rocks, or a gin and tonic. Women like manhattans. Some men pretend to enjoy martinis. Very few men actually enjoy martinis. No one enjoys dirty martinis.

My old fashioned is my favorite drink to make, and only a couple of handfuls of our most regular patrons know to order _my_ old fashioned. I can't give away my secret, but I've never been told it's not the best old fashioned they'd had.

Johnny knew to order my old fashioned. He'd come in almost every night, sometimes with a stack of papers he'd read and mark up. I never knew if they were his words or someone else's, and I knew better than to ask.

Johnny drank pretty fast, and eventually, he would switch to just double bourbons. He wasn't picky. He liked the cheap stuff just as much as the expensive stuff. Most of the cheap stuff, anyway.&nbsp;
