I guess I have technically already started, but I'm going to use this space to officially start this project, because starting will involve just getting a lot of stuff out of my head and onto a page.

I technically started because I bought a domain name and a Notion page in my personal Notion workspace. There's not much in the latter, however.

### Sections

- process

- architecture

- decision making at every level

- leading teams

### Market

- people who did bootcamp 2-3 years ago

&nbsp; &nbsp; - "now you got your job, how do you level up?"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - leveling up

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - senior title

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - better job

### The Basic Idea

- $5000 for 12 month program

- 1x 1hr group meeting per week

- ad-hoc mentoring sessions

&nbsp; &nbsp; - include N hours in plan, no limit on additional paid hours

&nbsp; &nbsp; - let mentors set their rate

- ~$100/hr of live sessions (52)

- include egghead membership in plan

&nbsp; &nbsp; - or make it a required purchase

- + books they'll have to buy

- + other non-egghead courses they'll have to buy

- run 10 person cohorts every month

- $50k/month

&nbsp; &nbsp; - $600k/year

I also have a Notion database with some useful references.&nbsp;

And now I have a Logseq page for quickly getting things down.

I'm hoping for a better name to come to me before I'm ready to launch.

I'm hoping to launch with something really low-effort and low-commitment. That will probably mean running a free version of this as a alpha test. That alpha test will have to be significantly shorter than the year-long planned program. Maybe 3 months? That's essentially 12 sessions.

This doesn't scale into a SaaS. It scales in the sense that once the curriculum is written it will just require constant gardening and refinement. I could also outsource the instruction / group facilitation.

It certainly doesn't scale in the sense of economies-of-scale. There will be a logical limit to how many people I could pump through this program per year, and assuming fully booked at what I estimate to be a reasonable monthly cohort maximum, it still only qualifies as a small lifestyle business.

I'm ok with all of that.
