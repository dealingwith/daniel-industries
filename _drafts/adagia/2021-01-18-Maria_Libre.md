Maria was old. She'd had her kids. She'd raised her kids. She'd lived in her house, those children running around her legs like puppies. She'd cooked the carnitas huevos rancheros, baked the churros, meticulously prepared the tamales, agonized over the mole sauce, perfected her tres leches cake, spent the better part of many afternoons stirring a giant pot of posole, amazed guests at the quality of her sopaipillas, left neighbors dumbfounded at the flavor of her homemade tortillas, quieted loud wedding receptions with her delicate flan, warmed cold children with her hot chocolate, lined arteries with her enchiladas and her rice pudding and her carnitas tacos.

Now Maria lived in a 500 square foot shack beside her third son's house. It sat on a busy street in a not-great neighborhood, not far from where her house stood when it was a good neighborhood. He would bring her a fresh delivery from the tortilleria and beg her to make her carne asada, chorizo, or al pastor. She would oblige with a smile and make him eat two with her at her small kitchen table before he took the rest back to his house for his voracious offspring.&nbsp;

In the mornings after she picked some eggs from the chicken coop, she'd make strong coffee and watch her favorite telenovelas. In the afternoons she would sit on the porch or nap. Her grandkids would run around the yard. At night she would turn off the lights and light candles and read her large-print Bible.

Maria didn't have a 401k or a retirement nest-egg. She didn't have a car, or a computer, or a mobile phone. She wore a watch but it hadn't worked in a decade.

Maria experienced more freedom than any other human being alive in 2021.
