_Another high-school creation. I'm capturing the ones worth keeping here, still wondering if I'm going to throw away the yellowed dot-matrix paper once I'm through._

The ant scurried across the walkway in front of Bob's house, nervously glancing in the approaching man's direction. The ant strained his legs to make them move faster. Bob gained. The ant fell into a crater formed by a drop of water that fell some time ago from a young boy's water pistol. The was all it took. Bob's foot ever so slowly, at least for the ant, fell upon the trapped insect.

Bob was hurrying down the front steps and into his silver gas-efficient car when he heard a long, loud car horn--a very unusual occurrence, as Bob lived in the country. Bob didn't think twice about it, though, and quickly threw his briefcase into the passenger seat. After he turned the key and slapped the accelerator to the floor, the engine roared to life. Bob slid down the driveway and onto the street. Today's drive was a special one, not because of its route, for Bob had driven it many times. It was unique because of its purpose. Today was to be a rewarding day.

Bob stopped at the end of his street, as he did every morning. He glanced to the left at the blind corner almost directly in front of the intersection, as he did every morning. Then he pulled out to the left, as he did every morning. Suddenly, Bob saw a car come around the corner. As if in slow motion, he saw the car approach, appear to almost dive forward as the driver slammed on the brakes, and then slam into the rear door of Bob's silver, gas-efficient car. Bob's car flew in the opposite direction. It hit a small bank and stopped. Bot sat, held in by his seat belt, still gripping the steering wheel with a death grip. He realized that he normally waited longer at that intersection.

As soon as the other driver managed to get his car to the side of the road, the man, obviously very irate, jumped out of his car like a person possessed. He spent a long time loudly and obnoxiously reaming Bob out. Bob stood by his car, not saying a word, just looking at the man. After the man calmed down, Bob gave him the necessary information. The man cursed some more before he got in his car, slammed the door, and tore away. Bob was even more shaken now. He assessed the damage to his car, which was considerably worse than that done to the other man's car. He managed to get it moving again and he slowly went on his way.

Bob's state of mind was considerably lamentable while he drove toward his destination. He had previously driven with happy anticipation and excitement. Now he drove with a mad soul and a long face.
