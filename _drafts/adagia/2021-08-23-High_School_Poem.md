In a box uncovered in the move, I found writing I'd done in high school. I had no idea I still had this stuff. It was printed on a dot-matrix printer nearly 30 years ago. Most of it is awful. Some is still ok in the light of 30 years of life and experience. I'm not sure what is going on in this one; I think that is why I kind of like it. It's very much like it was written by a different person.

> Reruns

>

> Nothing is quite so lonely

> As old reruns in the basement

> I sit and stare

> At the images that indicate the past

> The colors are so old

> And so alone

> That they suck the light from the air around me

> All I hear

> Is the din from the tube

> And the creaks from above

> I climb up the stairs

> The house is so dim!

> The reruns are the curse

> That enhances my pain

> A sudden paranoia fills my soul

> And I look all around for someplace to go

> I run to my car

> There is one place to go

> There will be people there

> People I know

> Dirt flies and I hurry to escape

> The curse of the reruns!

> The night is so dark

> Everything is something to fear

> The drive takes forever

> But finally I'm there

> But alas!

> There is no one
