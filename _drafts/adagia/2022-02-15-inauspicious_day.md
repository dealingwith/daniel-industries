Today was inauspicious to say the least. It started well enough: a 15-mile bike ride in the 36Â° 6:30am darkness, watching the sunrise over White Rock Lake.

But work was a slog, mostly because my brain and body gave up sometime around my late lunch.

Our app is a Rails 5 app with some gnarly legacy javascript and equally bad Ruby. Towards the end of the day, I floated the idea of re-writing the client-facing portion of the app as a brand-new, stand-alone Rails 7 app. Re-writes are not something I would normally propose. I know better. But. I was greeted with interested eyebrows and not stink-faces, which was good. We did some collective research on Rails 7.&nbsp;

But overall I felt like I got almost nothing done, and left at 6 with a headache and a hungry belly.

When I got home I was greeted with a new kettle for valentine's day and a delicious meal. I spent the night researching travel options for spring break. The thought of travel rejuvenated my soul.
