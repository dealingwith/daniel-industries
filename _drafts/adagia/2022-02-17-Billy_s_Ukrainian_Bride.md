Billy looked out from inside the chain-link. He glanced up at the razor wire across the top of the fence, a meter above his head. His mind wandered to the day many months ago when he read those words on his computer screen and immediately bought plane tickets to Ukraine.&nbsp;

She stood him up. He sat in the restaurant drinking beers until the room spun, waiting for her to show up. Just as his proverbial lights started to turn off, the troops came through the door.

Now he stands in the same clothes he put on that afternoon, staring through the chain-link, out onto a wind-blown field, listening to the Ukrainian and Russian being spoken all around him, wondering if he'll have a message from her when he gets out of there.

Then they can get married.
