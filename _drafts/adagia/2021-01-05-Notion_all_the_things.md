(This one is really just for the streak.)

I currently use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to manage large chunks of my life. I use their [table](https://www.notion.so/Tables-66a1cce8fb6f4f64b9996f4146c51fad) object with multiple views which apply different filters and sorting. My methodology is an unholy mashup of kanban and Getting Things Done. Each item has a "status"--Backlog, Up Next, Working or Done. Most of the views relate to these statuses.

- Focus table: a classic table view with just Working and Up Next
- Board: a kanban board view. I used to use this one more but am more apt to use table views now.
- Everything table: what it says on the tin
- MCU: short for "Minecraft U"--only items with the label "MCU"
- Backlog Grooming: just items with the Backlog status
- Inbox: items with no status

I give all that information just as a preamble. The thing about Notion which is a really sharp double-edged sword is that each item is a page that can contain multitudes. So an item can be a simple task--"Laundry" for instance--or it can be a "whole thing"--"2021" for instance.

Here is a subset of the content in "2021":

Do I have a theme for 2021?

- Narrow focus
- Let go
- Build
- Deep
- Land (??)
- Trudge the Road of Happy Destiny

Goals

- Just revisit...? (Link to another Notion page, "[Goals](https://www.notion.so/5715eea434b64c21aba190abf2d3fafb)")

Process

- I'd like to land on a single process I can trust in
- I've been liking Notion for tracking but something is missing&nbsp;

- I need a true roll-up

- But I also like the idea of having everything in one big table for seeing it all
- I don't think I can go back to Trello despite how long that worked for me
- I don't think Taskpaper has a spot anymore despite how long that worked for me and the Trellopaper tool I made
- Marvin? (No. Maybe.)
- Feedback/social

Thinking about

- Lack of drumming
- Creative work in general
- Happiness vs joy
