Norah, their resident client services genius, was not only beautiful and smart but could turn any customer crisis into a calm oasis.

"I heard all of that," Norah said as she entered.

"Just the usual," Howard said, trying to play it off. He was embarrassed that she had heard his minor freak-out. He was in love with her, after all.

"It might be the usual," she said, "but it's still not right." Her sympathetic tone washed over Howard like a warm shower. He felt blood begin to divert to his groin. This wouldn't be the first time Norah walked him back from the ledge. It wouldn't even be the tenth. "Let me get Sarah on the phone," she suggested, "she'll work some of her magic over there and I bet I can get you another two weeks on top of what Greg promised. They're not going to be ready by his date, anyway."

At this point, the blood was pooling in his cheeks as well as his dick, and Howard's embarrassment was matched only by his emotional relief to have Norah stepping in to fix his problem. If only she could fix all his problems so easily.
