Jim loved little pithy, imperative sayings. He loved having them all over his office.

"Do something great today," it said on the signboard.

"Trust the process," a wall hanging said.

"Be your best self," a poster unhelpfully suggested.

He also had a poster of Eddie Van Halen above his desk. No one was sure why.

The thing missing from Jim's office was Jim. He really only ever showed up to rotate the imperatives.

Where was Jim? What did he do? Why was he paying for this office he didn't use? And why did he love signs with imperative sentences so very much?

So many questions. Jim was a mystery. A very inspirationally bossy mystery.
