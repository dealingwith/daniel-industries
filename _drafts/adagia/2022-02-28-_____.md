“You did it again,” Max’s partner said as he slapped him on the back. “I don’t know how you always manage to get us out of these scrapes but somehow you always do. I just wish my blood pressure could understand.” He took another long drag off his cigarette. “Early lunch? Martinis on me.”

“Sounds great, Greg,” Max said. Just then his assistant knocked and immediately opened the door just far enough to poke her head through.&nbsp;

“Your wife on the phone,” she said.

“Alright,” Max waved her off and glanced at the blinking light on his phone.

“I’ll go warm up the car,” Greg said, and left, quietly closing the door behind him.

Max took one deep breath and picked up the phone, clicked the blinking button.

“Hey babe,” he said, in the most calm, settled, soothing voice known to man.
