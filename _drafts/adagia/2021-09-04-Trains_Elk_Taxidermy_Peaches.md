Jake remembered liking trains as a kid. He had a little wooden train set. Not a nice Brio set like his friends had. His parents couldn't afford one of those. He had some knock-off brand where the train didn't really run on the tracks right and got stuck all the time.

Jake's dad owned a peach orchard. He was famous in four counties for his peaches. Jake's dad passed when Jake was 20 and Jake took over the farm. That same year four different fungi invaded the orchard. The brown rot, peach scab, leaf curl, and gummosis all took hold and wiped out the entire operation. He had no choice but to sell the land. They grow soybeans on that land now. He heard they make milk out of 'em.

Jake joined a motorcycle gang called the Glorious Shades. One day on a road trip he stopped at Whiskey Pete's truck stop and saw a sticker of the ðŸ˜Ž emoji. He thought it was funny. He stuck it on his bike and when he got back home they kicked him out of the Glorious Shades over it.

Jake ended up a taxidermist. He'd mostly stuff the elk the pudgy, soft-skinned out-of-town hunters would bag on their hunting trip vacations. One time he got a call from someone a few counties south, just across the state border. The guy had an alligator. That job was so much work Jake took the rest of the week off. Paid real good, though. When the guy came back to pick it up, he told Jake, "He was a real killer, this one."

"Oh yeah?"

"Yeah, rumor has it he'd eaten a few people. A girl from Florida. A little boy from Mississippi."
