The recent-ish news about rational, intelligent, highly-trained people describing their experience of UFOs has me pretty excited. That excitement mostly stems from my technocapitalist-centric [optimism that we can progress ourselves out of the problems we've created through our progress](https://adagia.org/content/1689). I hold out hope that the aliens can and will save us.

I'm also looking forward to the religious and philosophical communities' epistemological yoga required when suddenly introduced to potentially 1000s of years' worth of scientific/technological progress.

"Oh, what you refer to as the 'collective unconscious' is just _this_ phenomenon that you haven't figured out how to observe or measure yet."

"Oh, how do we observe and measure it?"

"Well, you need this instrument."

"Ok, how do we build that instrument."

"Well, you need this element."

"What element is that?"

"Well, that element doesn't exist on Earth."

"Oh, how do we get that element, then?"

"Well, you'd have to travel 1000 light-years to the [name in another language] system."

"We only live 79 years, on average."

"Well, you have to travel through a fold in spacetime."

"How do you do that?"

"Well, you need this tool."

"Ok, how do we build that tool."

"Well, you need this element."

"What element is that?"

"Well, that element doesn't exist on Earth."

"Oh, how do we get that element, then?"

"Well, you'd have to travel 1000 light-years..."
