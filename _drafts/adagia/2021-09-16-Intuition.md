Where in that grey space between all the inputs we allow into our mind, all the thoughts that rattle around and through, and "forces...beyond human comprehension and the dualistic...space/time framework through which we understand reality", as Russell Brand puts it, lies our intuition, our ability to choose, our ability to make good decisions? If you hear "a still, small voice", the one "that so seldom can get through", as Over the Rhine says, how do you know when that voice is just one of those rattling thoughts, or an "intuitive thought", as the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous says, or really a message from beyond our own feeble methods and mythologies.

How much is just brain chemistry? I just recently had one of my antidepressive drugs' dose increased and it's been like the skies opening. It's like I can live again. What about the Sam Harrises of the world, who found enlightenment through X or shrooms or decades of meditation? What if those moments are the closest we're ever going to get?

> Forget about the answers

Over the Rhine said that, too.

I've become friends with the priest of the church I've started attending. We ride bikes together often. He has a really nice Italian bike he scored from someone who bought it and then never rode it. We were hitting a lot of green lights and I commented on the fact and said it must be Godly favor since he was on the ride. He said, "Oh, I chalked it up to Italian magic!" Had me laughing for a while.
