Bob was proud of his truck. It was an iridescent pearl Chevy Silverado LTD with jet black leather-appointed front seats. He washed it every week on Tuesday. Always at the touchless carwash, never at one of those with the giant waving paint-ruining brushes.

Bob had a fresh-smelling pine tree hanging from the rear-view mirror. He didn't have any guns in the rear-window gun rack, but he sure as shit kept a Glock in the glove compartment.

Bob wanted a smoothie. He pulled into the parking lot and into a space.

Not straight. Too far from Smoothie King.

Bob backed out. Not in one shot. He crept forward. He crept back. He crept forward. He crept back. Clear.

Bob drove three miles per hour around the bend in the parking lot. He pulled into the space in front of Smoothie King. Not straight. Fuck it.
