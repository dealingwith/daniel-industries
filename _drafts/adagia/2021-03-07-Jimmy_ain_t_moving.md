Jimmy remembers it like it was yesterday. It was 1982. The two men in polyester suits knocked on the door. The one with coke bottle glasses introduced himself and cut to the chase. The mining company they represented had purchased all the land around Jimmy's lot. They were prepared to make a "generous offer" for Jimmy's house and land. Jimmy told them to go fuck themselves and slammed the door in their faces.

They came back the next day. Again, Jimmy told them to go fuck themselves and slammed the door in their faces.

They came back the next day with a third--a woman, an attractive woman, who also worked for the mining company. This time Jimmy, who was raised right, didn't use any vulgarity or slam the door in their faces. He simply said, "Not interested," and closed the door in their faces.

They gave it a week and came back, this time with the woman and the CEO of the mining company. He looked like Boss Hogg but in a black suit instead of a white one. He did the talking this time. He led with the numbers, which he suggested they had adjusted in Jimmy's favor, and he further suggested that anyone who didn't take that kind of money for this kind of house would be a fool. Jimmy thought of some choice words for the man, but the woman was still there, so he simply said, "Not interested,' and closed the door in their faces. The CEO knocked on the door again. This time his demeanor had changed. He threatened Jimmy. He said the operation was going forward with or without Jimmy's land. He said they were going to tear this entire area up and Jimmy would be living in the middle of a "war zone" within just a few years. Jimmy proverbially bit his tongue. He said, "You, sir, are a terrible human being," and shut the door in their faces.

Now, in 2021, Jimmy sat in his living room. He contemplated the leak in the back room. He looked out the window across the [torn land](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.6324258,-96.662721,3a,75y,163.13h,102.96t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqJJGVK_ydLDyHUyceAhXQA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). He thought about how many times the police had come to ask about what he had seen the night before--they'd found another dead body dumped in the water that flooded the old pits.
