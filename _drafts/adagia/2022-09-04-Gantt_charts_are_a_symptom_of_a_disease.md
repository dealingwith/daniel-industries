[Gantt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gantt) charts are a symptom of a disease. They're like an alcoholic's first DUI. But if you're a startup with a product/engineering team of 5, they're like an alcoholic's first DUI at 16.

Gantt charts are a leading indicator of an organization's or department's demise. They are an indication that a team in a rowboat is starting to bring onboard the steel for the icebreaker they think they're building.

Gantt charts are literally [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). The chart is the waterfall.

> The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries, where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process. When first adopted for software development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based creative work.

But it's not just that Gantt charts are a step away from effective, iterative software development.

**Gantt charts are a defense mechanism against a lack of trust.**

This is an ongoing topic on this website. In the past I've quoted [Agile as Trauma](https://doriantaylor.com/agile-as-trauma) [here](https://www.daniel.industries/2020/02/15/agile-and-hiring/):

> There exists many a corner office whose occupant, if forced to choose, will take an absence of surprises over a substantive outcome.

...and Marty Cagan [here](https://www.daniel.industries/2021/10/28/process-people/):

> I certainly understand the attraction of scaling with process, and the hunger for a framework or some form of “recipe for success” at scale. But that’s just not the reality in good companies. The truth is that product leadership is hard.

So this is a difficult problem, but why? And why do so many people in business get it wrong?

One reason is that building an effective organization is complex and multivariant. Few people have the broad experience required to build an effective organization. Most business leaders had, or stumbled upon, a reasonably good idea that had product-market fit, and started building. Scaling the organization required to sustain that idea as it spreads and grows is not in their wheelhouse.

Another reason is simple emotional fortitude. All humans make decisions through an emotional lens and few humans have the tools to tune that lens in constructive ways. Running a business is an inherently risky affair, fraught with anxiety, betrayal, and disappointment. We're more likely to build defenses against these experiences than we are to accept and learn from them. The affect landscape of running a business is an inherently trust-eroding one if one does not lean on their better angels.

A final reason is that businesses succeed despite these shortcomings. Product-market fit is by far the biggest component to a business's success, to the extent that even incredibly poorly-run businesses can succeed. There are other such components, and even luck, that matter more than one's software development processes.

So now what?
