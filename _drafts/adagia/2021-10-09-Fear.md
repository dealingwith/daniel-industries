In 12-step programs there are a lot of aphorisms and words-turned-into-acronyms. Many are hokey. Many are hokey but we don't care. Some are hokey until you need the message behind the thing, then they're useful, maybe even powerful.

"Fear" turned into an acronym is one of my favorites. There are multiples.

"Future events appearing real" is the most common. I like the layered, subtle message there.

"Fuck everything and run" is a funny one positioned as an anti-pattern.

"Face everything and recover" is my favorite, and providing the most use in my life right now.

That is all.
