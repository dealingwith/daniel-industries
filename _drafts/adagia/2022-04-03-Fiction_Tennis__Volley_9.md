It had been too long since Dempsey had been in a good, old-fashioned street brawl.

"It's been too long since I was in a good, old-fashioned street brawl," Dempsey thought as he spun to connect his elbow with the man's face. Blue Collar Man had sucker-punched Greg, who was just now picking himself up off the sidewalk. Dempsey had answered with a left hook, which failed to connect. He wasn't sure why he went with the left. Somewhere deep inside, he knew Blue Collar Man was outnumbered and outmatched, so he wanted to make it interesting. But the dude was fast enough to grab Dempsey's arm as it flew in front of his face, forcing the spinning elbow, which connected with the side of the man's amble head with a dull thud.

"Ow," Blue Collar Man said as he reached for his head. Dempsey knew that wouldn't provide any real break in his opponent's offenses, so he completed his 360Â° turn, crouched down, and then connected with an uppercut to Blue Collar's groin. The poor guy barely had time to grown when Greg, now back on his feet, came down on his shoulder with a brachial stun, resulting in his collapse on top of Dempsey. Prepared, Dempsey dumped him onto the sidewalk, and Greg put a foot on his neck just as he was coming to.
