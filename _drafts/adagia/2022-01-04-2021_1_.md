As I look back on my 2021, it's hard to land on a single theme. _Persevere_, maybe. _Ride_, maybe. "Narrow Focus" was my theme going in. I don't think I did so well in that regard. I recently [wrote](https://www.daniel.industries/2021/10/12/theres-a-slow-revolution-going-on/):

_As I pause myself to reflect on this last season, to recuperate but mostly to learn, this is the theme: How did I once again revert to the hyperactive hive mind? Where was I at fault? How can I find and create an environment where real value is created? Some things stick out already. If one is to do less, one must make sure what one is doing is of the highest value possible. To do that, one must make intelligent, calculated bets._

That was in regards to my work life, but have I done that in my personal life? My goals for 2021 were:

1. Fix energy levels. Check!
2. Weigh 205lbs. 190lbs! Check! And probably highly correlated to #1.
3. Record one of Lucy's songs. Nope.
4. Finish [_100 200-word character sketches_](https://adagia.org/project/9)_._ Nope.
5. Finish my short story book. Nope.

So fitness-wise, I had one of my best years of the last 20. Creatively, I had (another) bad year.

But I'm not sure it's because I wasn't focused. I did once again fall victim to social media's ills, but I once again quit all social media in October. Maybe I've just blocked a lot of memories pre-October. I did have rather eventful months in the last quarter of 2021...
