6:30 I started by not quite getting moving thoroughly enough to get a ride in in the hour (7:00-8:00) I had before The Girl's volleyball game. I worked instead which turned out to be good...I was actually productive and I hope helpful. I knew I had to get some work done today so I'm glad it happened early as the rest of the day, well...

8:30 volleyball. Then she wanted to stay for her friends' volleyball game, so I took that duty.&nbsp;

11:30 home, checked on work stuff, ate, took a power nap.

14:00 took the kids to a bike shop opening where there was a BMX freestyle show. It was really hot by this point, and it was a long drive. Mom had a two-hour shoot which meant she was gone for over three hours. We were so hot when we got back that we jumped straight into the pool. Mom got home.

18:00 then it was time to go to the neighborhood party, which was about .5 miles away. Kids jumped on scooters and we walked. Still really hot. We ate too much delicious food from the waffle truck. The kids ran and ran. Luca played on an outside movie screen they had set up for the party. It finally started to cool off after sunset but then it was the .5 mile walk home...uphill this time.

21:50 Now for all of us to get clean and crash! Poof, there went a day.
