Brent was a transcendental meditation expert. In the 70s he wrote _the_ book on the subject. In the 80s he released a series of cassette tapes. In the 90s, a CD-ROM. In the 00s he launched his website. In the 10s, an app. Now he has a podcast. His podcast is sponsored by mushroom coffees, artisanal meditation pillows, natural sleep aids, sleep tracking devices, organic multivitamins, but mostly by other meditation apps and podcasts.

Brent has peers in the industry on his show, but his favorite guests are the doe-eyed Millennials who eat up his words with a spoon.

Brent ends every episode with a mantra for his listeners to use that week. He never pauses between the mantra and the last ad read.

Brent clicks off the mic, lights a Camel, takes a deep drag. The cloud of smoke wafts up into the Himalayan prayer flags hanging from a string draped across the ceiling.
