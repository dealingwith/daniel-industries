Bo lived alone above the detached garage. His Mercedes-Benz sedan was parked on the street. A couple, significantly younger than him, owned the place. He rented. His ex-wife still lived in his last house, now not his house. He could buy another house. But he chose to rent the garage above the detached garage. He didn't really need to work anymore. But he chose to work at the financial services office he founded 35 years ago but sold to private equity seven years ago.

Bo's special talent was making people feel bad. Nothing ever lived up to Bo's standards. The world conspired to test Bo's patience. Society was crumbling. Everything was terrible.

"You told me yesterday it would be ready today!" he barked at the pharmacist. She dealt with him patiently but he would have none of it.&nbsp;

"This is highway robbery!" he would exclaim at any given checkout clerk, comparing 2020 prices with those of 1979. Late capitalism had shown its light upon Bo, but he still considered 1980 to be the beginning of the end.

"Fucking GO!" he would shout at the driver in front of him as if they could hear him. He would continue his tirade as if they were replying in equal profanity.
