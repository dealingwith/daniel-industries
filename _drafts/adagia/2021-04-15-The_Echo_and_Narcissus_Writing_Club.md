Today I enrolled in the [Echo and Narcissus Writing Club](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/echo-and-narcissus-writing-club/118), which is being facilitated by my coworker, UX designer, art director, and anthropologist [Maggie Appleton](http://maggieappleton.com/). I'm excited for a couple of reasons. First, it will motivate me to write more, and I will have this space to share that writing with. Second, Maggie is a very bright and good human, and I'm excited to learn from her (and the others in the club).

Learning clubs are the new hotness, and for good reason. Besides Hyperlink Academy, there is [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com), and egghead is running all kinds of learning clubs now ([for example](https://egghead.io/blog/saas-application-with-next-js-stripe-and-firebase)). My seedling of an idea, everythingelse.dev, is an idea for an extended learning club.

They're not new. In fact we joke about how people are discovering these methodologies as if for the first time. "It will be a group of people learning this stuff _at the same time_! I think I'll call it...a _class_! Yeah, yeah. And there will be one person who's an expert and helps the group learn. I'll call them...a _teacher_! It's crazy, right?" I think there are some interesting differences, however; this new version is somehow [a cross between a book club, a community college course, and a Dungeons and Dragons game](https://joelhooks.com/knowledge-adventure-club). They are specifically geared towards adult, casual learners, like book clubs. They are slightly more rigorous than that, though. And they involve technologies in ways novel to the space.
