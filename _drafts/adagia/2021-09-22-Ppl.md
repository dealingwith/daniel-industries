1. Wife and kids. Obvs.

2. I have a friend and we have a deal where he calls me every day and we are supposed to hold ourselves accountable to do certain daily habits but mostly we just bullshit for about 30 minutes every time. I just got off the phone with him.

3. Oddly, I don't talk to coworkers that much. We're a remote company and use the written word more than we talk. We have a new operations manager and I probably talk to him the most, as we're in a few different standing meetings each week, one of them a 1-on-1.

4. I talk to my parents, who are in Oklahoma, on zoom once a week on Wednesday nights and usually my sister joins from Florida as well. We usually end up talking for about an hour and a half.

5. My biking friends. I have two friends who I ride with regularly, so we talk for most of those rides. One is a real estate investor and the other is a priest. The priest has a lot of tattoos and likes tacos and Rush.
