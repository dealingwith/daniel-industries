Bill was a recently divorced 50-something bar manager who looked at least 10 years younger than he was, which was fortunate because he almost exclusively found women 15-20 years younger than him attractive.&nbsp;

Bill really liked this woman, and she'd agreed to go to dinner, but he wasn't sure if she knew he hoped it was a date. Like, a date-date. In fact, he was pretty sure she didn't consider it a date, so in the hours leading up to it he was busy trying to figure out how to make the forthcoming non-date into a date-date.

They grabbed sushi and took it back to her place--pandemic and all--but Bill considered it a good sign that she at least trusted him enough to have him over. He was also relieved he didn't have to come up with an excuse to not go to his poor excuse for a house. He had some cool art and a killer vinyl collection, but you could practically see through the floorboards.

They had sushi and Bill talked too much. He always did that when he really liked someone. They hugged goodbye. Bill tried to prevent blood redistribution during the hug and was actually kind of relieved it was short-lived, even though it had been over half a year since he'd touched another human being.
