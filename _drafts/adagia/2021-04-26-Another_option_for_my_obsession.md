One of my all-time favorite opening sentences, that of William Gibson's _Neuromancer_. Gibson is another one of those authors I deeply admire, but I've only ever read Neuromancer. I might have read&nbsp;_Burning Chrome&nbsp;_at some point.

Gibson coined the word&nbsp;_cyberspace_. Not many contemporary authors coin terms that are actually adopted by the culture.

This would also give me an excuse to read more of his work.
