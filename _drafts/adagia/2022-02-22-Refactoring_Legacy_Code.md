Sometimes the Idea was a good idea, and while it didn't pan out at the time, it still might in the future, but the code is really bad code, and that's ok, just delete the code.

Sometimes the developers who wrote the code were simply untrained, inexperienced, or both, and that's ok, just delete their code.
