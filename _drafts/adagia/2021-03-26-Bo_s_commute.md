Bo tended not to move, but on the odd occasion he had to drive into the office, it was always terrible. His new place was on one side of downtown and the office was on the other. Traffic was always terrible. It seemed like every other driver on the road was a terrible driver. Bo drove with his thumb on the horn.

Thursday Bo had to go into the office. He didn't have to go in until 10am but the traffic was still horrible. "Why do you all keep moving to this city?!" he shouted. A Toyota pickup in front of him hit the brakes suddenly and Bo was certain it was only because he was driving close, waiting for the guy to get over. Why couldn't the guy just get over?

He meant to only be in the office for the one lunch meeting but somehow he got dragged into a few conversations and next thing he knew Bo was driving home at 5:00. Traffic on the highway was at a standstill. He cut over onto the shoulder and snuck off the next exit, a plume of dust and stones in his wake. Suddenly, he was downtown.

He hit the three-lane one-way street down the center of downtown, determined to make better time than if he had just stayed on the highway. Then he saw it. A group of people on cruiser bicycles taking up two lanes, forcing all the traffic over. He gripped the steering wheel tightly as he applied the brakes and got in line to pass. Then, he smelled the distinct aroma of marijuana smoke. His face flushed the brightest red and his brain exploded.
