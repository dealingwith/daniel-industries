Yardi you are so

Frustratingly long with your &nbsp;

Changing requirements &nbsp;

My foot, it is numb

It seems I am old now and &nbsp;

Always have a problem &nbsp;

I am overwhelmed

I will never get to all &nbsp;

The things that need done &nbsp;

I am always tired

Not sure where to lay blame &nbsp;

It could be anything &nbsp;

Long Winters on the

Streaming service of my choice &nbsp;

We don't care about art &nbsp;

All software is crap

To build something uncrappy &nbsp;

You must fly solo &nbsp;

Allow committees

Or fire everyone who smells &nbsp;

There is no mid-ground &nbsp;

Who is the common

Denominator? You are &nbsp;

Of course you are, ass
