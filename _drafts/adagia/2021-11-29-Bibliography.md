I'm working on a personal bibliography (a literary _uses_ page if you will). Here's what I have so far.

Life stuff:

- _Man's Search for Meaning_ by Frankl. Probably the most influential book in my life, I read it in high school or college. Haven't re-read it in a while, need to pick it back up again.
- _Sacred Journey_ by Mike Riddell. A modern book of wisdom for life by one of my favorite authors.
- _The Second Mountain_ by David Brooks. I'm only just now reading this book, slowly, two chapters a week, as part of my self-organized book club (which has 5 members, including myself), but it fits this sequence of life advice / modern wisdom tomes.
- _Designing Your Life_ by Burnett and Evans. Same with this book, I'm only about 33% through, but working through it carefully.
- _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport. Same again! But this sequence really works for me, going from high level down to more tactical as one works down this list.

Leadership stuff:

- _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ by Patrick Lencioni. Quick read and a classic business leadership and collaboration book.
- _Recovering Leadership_ by Tom Hill III.&nbsp;

Engineering stuff:

- _The Phoenix Project_
- _An Elegant Puzzle_ by Will Larson

Fiction:

- _Neuromancer_ by Willian Gibson
- Any early _Xanth_ novel by Piers Anthony
- _The Rider_ by Tim Krabbe

What would be in your personal bibliography?
