Tris woke on the mat Zhao had supplied him with no concept of time. The warehouse was still lit in the same dim light. He heard Zhao shuffling about inside the caravan. Suddenly the old man appeared at the door and headed straight for Tris. “Time to go,” he said. Tris rose unsteadily but was trained to not outstay any welcome.

Tris went to head towards the door he’d run through the day before but Zhao snipped, “No! This way,” and headed to the far end of the warehouse. Tris followed as he zig-zagged through a disorganized section of the warehouse, piles of miscellaneous objects forming the halls instead of the tall metal shelves elsewhere. Finally, Zhao paused next to an oddly-placed piece of carpet, bent down, and flung the carpet aside. Beneath was a makeshift manhole cover. It was pulled open, revealing a ladder. They quietly descended.&nbsp;

The tunnels underneath the warehouse were dry but the smell was undeniable. Zhao had a secret egress through the sewer. Tris was relieved when their time below ended at another ladder, which Zhao ascended after extending a hand towards Tris that clearly indicated, “Wait.” From the top, he popped open what looked like a legitimate manhole cover and stuck his head out of the top. Then, a wave that said, “Come on.”
