"That woman," Miriam rolled her eyes and picked up her coffee, extending one pinky as she raised it to her lips.

"I _know_," Aaron replied, drawing out his words and making a grimacing face as though he'd just smelled the meat that had gone bad in the fridge last week.

"I mean, _who_ does he think he _is_?" she asked, rhetorically.

"I mean, how could he possibly be in charge if he makes decisions like that?"

"Right?!"

Aaron tore the bread in front of them in half. "I already almost wish that meat hadn't gone bad," he said, widening his eyes involuntarily at the memory of the entire ordeal.

"Maybe we should have a word. You know, with the person in charge," Miriam suggested, almost as a question.

"You mean, with _the one_?" Aaron was shocked but intrigued.

"Yes, that's exactly who I mean," Miriam said. "If Moses is going to marry someone like _that_, surely he shouldn't be calling all the shots around here."

"I suppose you're right," Aaron conceded. "_Somebody_ needs to be the adult in the room."

"Exactly!"
