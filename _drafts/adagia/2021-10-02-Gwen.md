Gwen was the P.E. teacher at Limestone Elementary. Her daughter was on the Gemstone High volleyball team. Gwen's ex was the coach of the St. Patrick High girl's volleyball team. Whenever Gemstone played St. Patrick, Gwen had to skip so she wouldn't see her ex. Her ex was now with the coach of the Peter's High girl's basketball team. Gwen loved high school basketball but had to skip whenever it was a game against Peter's High because her ex would be there to support her new partner.

Gwen's new partner was the sous chef at&nbsp;_Pain et Vin_, the nicest restaurant in town. At least she hadn't partnered up again within the incestuous district athletics scene. Except being an athlete paired with a chef meant they were mostly passing like ships--no, more like spies--in the night. Speaking in code, tired all the time, giving their best hours to their professions and vocations.

Gwen missed having someone there to support her when she coached Bishop Middle's field hockey team.
