So I just happened across a button somewhere on this site that said, "Make Progress" and I was immediately inspired, compelled even, to write. It's curious how the copy on a digital button can change things. Had it said simply "Write" I might have gone back to some other task. I'm tired. I felt uninspired. (I did in fact have to ask my wife for a prompt. She said "grave digger" because today I dug a grave for a hamster.)

I can't find that button now. Where did it go? I may never know. Maybe Adagia has become sentient and changes itself before our eyes
