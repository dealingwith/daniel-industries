"The board suggested to Tim that the company acquire two apartments for visiting executives. You're to have one on an indefinite basis."

Bo couldn't help but smile. "Who's idea was it?"

"The rumor is Del made the recommendation. Tim is pissed."

Bo's smile widened. Del was an asshole, but he was still Bo's asshole friend.

"I've arranged for a moving company to come move your things. They have three different sized trucks. Which one should they use?"

Bo looked around. "The smallest," he replied.

"Ok, that's it. I have the address. I'll call when I have a definite date and time, or I can just text it to you."

"Just text it."

"Ok. It will probably be tomorrow or the day after."

"That's fine." Bo paused. "And thanks."

"You're welcome, sir."

Bo hung up, grunted as he heaved himself off the couch, walked to the kitchen, pulled a bag of trash bags out of the cabinet below the sink, pulled out a trash bag, and started picking up. He hoped the trash was still being picked up while the house was empty.

As he made his way around the room, he paused at the collection of plaques next to the TV, simultaneously proud and puzzled as to their nature, the business achievements they represented. Maybe he should get a box and pack those himself, he thought, not leave their care to the movers.

"Nah," Bo said out loud and began tossing them into the trash bag.
