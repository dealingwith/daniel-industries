Daniel got so depressed he finally picked up his guitar. It needed work or humidity. He'd thrown the humidifiers away in the move. He played the few new tunes he'd written down in his little Field Notes notebook. They didn't sound as good anymore. And the one little riff he'd messed around with last time he picked up his guitar, many months ago. He was pleased he could still remember it, simple as it was.

This week had been a mysterious fog of depression. No reason. No triggers. Just depression. Just existential dread. Small bright spots. Finishing a book. A book club meeting. An AA meeting. Mostly, though, the week had been like walking through hip-deep mud. Depression is a swamp. There are gators.

The new tunes needed lyrics and melody and bridges. The magical girl was helping with the first two but claimed she couldn't remember any of it. She sat at the drums and kept a beat with just the kick and the snare. Beginnings.

She lingered after the brief musical moment and he pulled out the single-player dungeon crawler game notebooks that had been stacked on the bookshelf for months. They dug through cabinets to find six-sided dice and learned how to play. One notebook each. He died in level 4.
