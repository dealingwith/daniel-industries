[I'm a very aspirational reader](http://www.daniel.industries/2020/08/05/committed-to-read-non-stop-until-2100/)

**I opened Kindle this morning and thought...**

_A Hidden Burrow Near Barcombe_, I need to pick that one up. My friend David wrote it and the first in that series was so good!

_Moonwalking with Einstein_. Stewart gave me that one. I need to read it!

_[secret book I'm not going to tell you the title]_. Yeah, I want to read that one. ðŸ˜¼

_Clockwork Boys_. Supposed to be really good!

_Piranesi_. Ditto!

_the tiny mba._ Alex's really short, undoubtedly awesome tome.

_The Motive_. Everything Lencioni writes is good, and it's probably a short, easy read!

_The gift; forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies_. Duh.

_For he can Creep_. Supposed to be good, and short.

_The Plague._ I started this one a year ago!

_The Obstacle is the Way_. Obvs.

_I Will Teach you to be Rich_. I'll never get rich if I don't read this book already!

_Wool_. Carissa said this was soo good.

_Ask Polly's Guide to your Next Crisis_. I've liked almost everything she's written that I have read

_Designing your Life._ I really need to design my life!

_Keep Going_. Austin is kind of a big deal. I should read one of his books. Short, too!

_Choose Yourself_. Finally. One I made it far enough into that I don't feel bad leaving it behind. Sorry, Mr Altucher.

_The Cloud of Unknowing._ GOD, I'm into too many things.

_How to Play a Video Game_. How many years have I owned this book and intended to read it?

**I opened Google Play Books and thought...**

_The Last of the Mohicans_. I just started this one, I really need to read it or take it off my "currently reading" list.

_A Journal of the Plague Year_. I do respect Defoe, of course. But I probably want to read Camus' first.

_Just Enough Research._ Yep.

_Resilient Management._ Ditto.

_The Varieties of Religious Experience._ I don't have much hope of making it through this one despite my better intentions.

_Meditations_ . I started this one a while ago. What happened?

_Just Fucking Ship_. "Just Fucking Read."

_Twenty Bits_. Love Dan.

_The Lady of the Barge. Through the Looking-Glass. Walden._ I DO love [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org). I could only read stuff off of that site for the rest of my life.

_Walkaway._ Cory, take me away.

**I refused to go to the "next 50" page in Google Play Books.**

**I refused to peruse my physical stacks.**
