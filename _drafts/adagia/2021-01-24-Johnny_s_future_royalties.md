Johnny sat at a small bar in a small hotel in a small borough in a large, famous city in a large, famous state. He was drunk.

He'd called me ten hours before and I'd bought a plane ticket and flown across the country to meet him here. I was his agent until about four years ago. He fired me and hired a younger man from the famous city, who convinced him to sell a majority share in his future royalties to a private equity firm. Johnny was washed up, no one was hiring him anymore, and he was an infamous drunk, tolerated by the small local police department until he punched a woman. For that, he spent a night in the drunk tank. She'd insulted his work.

"Have a drink," he begged me as soon as I walked up.

"I would prefer not to," I said. I'd had one on the plane, but that was plenty. I was tired, and even though I knew I would find him intoxicated, it still annoyed me. "Let's talk about what you made me come out here for," I said.

"Tomorrow," he replied. "That can wait until tomorrow. I'm very drunk right now and have no plans to stop being so. Get a room here and drink with me.

"I got a room already."

"Fantastic. Then, a drink."

"Bartender, a bitter lemon and a menu, please. I'm starved."
