Jimmy worked for Urinal Solutions, Inc. They didn't just make urinal pucks. They made anti-splash mats, floor mats for in front of urinals, those little cleaner dispensers that shoot solution into urinals when they flush. They distributed urinal parts and serviced urinals in the greater St. Louis metro area. Their shirts said "US" over the pocket. There was another shirt that said "US is US" with a little American flag next to the text. There was an old shirt that some of the old-timers still had that said "Urinals-r-US" but they hadn't printed that one in years.

The modest factory floor smelled very clean and Jimmy enjoyed it as it seeped into the lab where he molded plastic and played with new puck compounds. It wasn't what he imagined when he was studying chemistry in college, but here he was. He met someone at a conference once who created the solution for port-o-potties and that sounded unbearable. The company's campus, if you could call it that, was in an industrial district that was centrally located, as these things go. It was starting to gentrify and some kind of interior design company had moved into the former door factory building next door. Jimmy's mind often wandered to the future, where he suspected US, Inc. was squeezed out of the market by a Chinese competitor and he had to go work at Dow, DuPont, or BASF making some new chemical that would finally destroy the earth.
