Johnny flew down the highway, snaking around traffic, 90 to their 60.

Johnny's face was lit by the red and blue lights in his rear-view mirror.

Johnny always remembered the movie Heat when he drove like this. The scene where Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are racing through Los Angeles highways before meeting to discuss their conflict in a diner.

Johnny was in the bar, the one he didn't frequent but enjoyed when he did head to the north part of the city. He managed his alcohol well. He was almost always overserved.

Johnny's girlfriend broke up with him over the phone. She'd just been over the night before, so the news hit him like a ton of bricks. There was probably someone else. He probably had an STD.

Johnny's body was dragged from the mangled wreckage and laid on the concrete of the highway.

Johnny hit the wall.
