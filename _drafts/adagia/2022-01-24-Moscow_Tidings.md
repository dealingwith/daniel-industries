Moscow Tidings' name sounded like some kind of weird joke. A greeting no one would ever use. "Moscow tidings," a Russian friend might say when they picked up the phone. Moscow was a "digital nomad," which meant he lived out of his van, often parked down by the river like that Chris Farley character in Saturday Night Live. Except Moscow was calm like you expect all van life people to be, based on Instagram.

One day Moscow was listening to random Spotify playlists and came across a song that described Jesus as a "homeless man" and by midnight that night, he had fallen to his knees and devoted his life to doing the work of the Lord.

The next day he started reading the gospels. Then Paul's letters. He saw that Paul really wanted to be Jesus. He also abandoned his home and adopted life on the road to spread the Good News. Moscow already had the life on the road part down. Now he just needed to learn how to spread the Good News.

His Kindle filled with new books, the likes of which it had never held before. Moscow forgot to eat some days. His eyesight faltered from the constant reading.

It was sometime in the second week following his conversion that Moscow decided he was ready. He started the van and pulled away from the campsite by the river. He felt called to a specific city in Idaho. He pulled up Josh Ritter on Spotify and headed west.
