Today started with a bit of a sleep-in. 8am. Although, to be fair, last night ended with an unusually late night.

By 10am we were at a local presbyterian church for the cub scouts pinewood derby. There is a whole backstory to this that will have to wait. But due to lack of tooling and lack of time, this year my son got a kit car from the hobby store. It still involved sanding, and gluing on body parts, and painting, and applying stickers, and clear-coating. But it was a kit.

He didn't win or place in the races, but he did get "judge's choice" for best car. He was THRILLED.

We were home by 11:30. At 11:50 I took the 18-year-old to work at Starbucks. He told me about their recent raises to $15 an hour.&nbsp;

I got home and started getting ready for the gravel bike ride I had arranged for 1pm. Everyone -- meaning my three riding companions -- were on time and we rolled down to the levees, where the gravel roads are, literally in the shadow of downtown Dallas.

It was a good ride. A little over two hours. It was cold, and there was a ferocious headwind for the first half of the ride, but my legs were good. There was some alternative trail exploration that was pretty tricky but interesting.

I got home just in time for my significant other to leave for the first of two photoshoots. I hadn't even showered when my son asked to throw the football. So we did. When he tired of the football, I recruited him to help me clean my dirty bicycle. We washed it together and cleaned and oiled the chain. He likes to turn the cranks by hand while I wipe the chain clean.

I started working on my other bicycle while he shot basketballs in the driveway. There were some adjustments it required and I also cleaned it while I had it in the work stand.

I showered, did laundry, read some emails, played chess with my son.

And yet I feel like I didn't get anything done today.&nbsp;

Now I've put him to bed, and I'm exhausted and unmotivated. I'm going to try to read some before sleep arrives.
