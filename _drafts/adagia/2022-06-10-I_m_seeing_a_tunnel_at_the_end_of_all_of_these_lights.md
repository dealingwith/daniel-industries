there's no time to think about it

only time to react to

all the shit. ha ha.

"teh" was autocorrected

to the, because help

I'm remembering going to see Travis in California. With a previous girl I have no idea about anymore despite all we shared and a previous best friend who's now gone crazy, it seems. We sat in the very back row of a large theater. It was a great show. At one point Fran Healy came to the front of the stage with just an acoustic guitar and no amplification and played a song. We could hear it just fine in the very back of the theater. The crowd was completely silent in their mesmerization.
