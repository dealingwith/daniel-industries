Johnny was so handsome. That was, for sure, the first thing I noticed about him, and the main thing I cared about at the beginning. Being on his arm made me feel important. It made me feel beautiful.

We lived in a tiny apartment in Queens. I thought at an elementary school while he wrote. He wrote in the kitchen, which was open to the small dining and living room area. He wrote furiously on a very loud typewriter. It was comical until it was infuriating. He'd type so fast, then pull the paper out of the typewriter and hand-write on the page. Often he would then throw the paper away. Sometimes he would put it in his file drawer in the corner of the living room. Rarely the page went on the pile on the dining table.

"When are you going to try to sell something," I would ask. He would grunt in reply.

Then he did sell something. And that was the beginning of the end.

I remember she was with him at divorce court. I never thought that he was trying to hurt me more, I just thought that he must have been the most inconsiderate man in all of history. For Johnny, there were the worlds in his mind, his typewriter, and his dick. There was nothing else.
