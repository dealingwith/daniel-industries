title: My current task management system

I have two relatively distinct task management workflows for personal vs work.

Personal:&nbsp;

- Capture all tasks into a single Notion database, which has multiple views, although the view I use 90% of the time is a kanban board view.
- Some tasks are actually projects, where the database page contains inline todos. I'm not crazy about this because I can't see those todos at a glance. Sometimes I move the inline todo items up into the database as separate pages/cards.
- I have a metadata property on each database card called "Project". I then have separate Notion pages for each project containing an inline database view filtered by that project. I really only reference these pages about once a week, however.
- To track what I want/need to do on any particular day, I use a small moleskin notebook or Field Notes and write bullet journal style todos in the notebook.
- For notes, I use Logseq. Occasionally, I will put inline todos into Logseq, but I find they get lost, despite the default "TODO" page that automatically collates all todos within the system.

Work:

- I also maintain a central Notion database for my ongoing work todos, however I don't actually reference it very often. I have another Notion database for "Daily Notes" displayed in a list view. Every day I create a new page for that day. I copy inline todos from prior day(s) into that day's page, reprioritizing and reorganizing as I go. I also jot down any other notes into these daily pages (much like I use Logseq for any general notes).
- If I'm having a 1-on-1 meeting or just don't want to have my computer open in a meeting, I use that same moleskin to take notes and then transfer them into another Notion database I use for meeting notes documents.

And that's where I've landed at the moment with my ever-changing task management system. I'm never happy with any system. I've tried every todo app out there. I'm constantly tweaking my system, always thinking about how I could improve it.

What is your system?
