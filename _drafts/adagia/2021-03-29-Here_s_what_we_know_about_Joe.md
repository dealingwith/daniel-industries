Joe loved cats.

Joe could fix anything on any engine built before 1988.

Joe could groove. Joe could groove really hard.

Joe's groove extended beyond the drum kit and the conga drums. Joe's groove was evident when he walked down the street, when he walked into the club, when he slid into the diner booth, when he popped a cigarette into his mouth leaning against the glass outside the diner, when he put on his leather jacket, when he freestyle rapped for his friends' entertainment at a party, when he took off his glasses to read a book in his high-backed leather chair, when he dropped two ice cubes in his whiskey glass, when he flipped steaks on a grill, as he slid into a hot tub, as he donned a hat, as he swung a racquetball racquet, when he walked around Central Park, as he entered a subway car, when he played guitar "just for fun", when he sang karaoke, when he twirled spaghetti onto his fork, when he stood in the back of the club bobbing his head to someone else's groove, when he kissed a woman's hand, when he bowed, when he opened a taxi door for someone, when he walked through revolving doors.

But mostly Joe grooved hardest sat on stage, in the back, beads of sweat rhythmically falling from his forehead, the sticks moving effortlessly across the skins and the metal of the cymbals, his eyes closed except to look up at his bandmates, communicating without words, one with the music.
