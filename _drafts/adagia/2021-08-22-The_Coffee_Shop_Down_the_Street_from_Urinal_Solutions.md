"I got you a bag of coffee from here." Jimmy knew it was a non sequitur but hoped for the best.

"Aw, thanks!"

"Do you have a grinder? We can have them grind it if not."

"I don't have a coffee maker," she said sheepishly.

"Nothing at all? Oh, I'm sorry. I feel stupid."

"No, no. I appreciate the gesture. I have a friend in my building who will love it. I'll go have it with her."

Jimmy searched for the right words but was silent. He'd never felt so awkward.

"Hey! You avoided the work question. I had just asked you where you worked and you never told me. You're a chemist, right?"

"Yeah...sort of."

"What do you mean, 'Sort of'?"

"Well, I'm not inventing anything interesting. Some new fragrances, maybe."

"Ooo! You work for a perfume company?"

"No."

"What, then?" Jeanie's innocent, authentic curiosity had not wavered.

Jimmy picked at the table, eyes downcast. "I work at a company...a company called Urinal Solutions."

"NO!"

"Yes." Jimmy knew this was the end.

"That's amazing! You have to tell me more!"

Jimmy looked up. He would have assumed she was making fun of him, but her voice did not betray her, and now he could see in her face that she was astonished but nothing if not genuine.
