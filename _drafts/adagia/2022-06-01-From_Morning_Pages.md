I've thought more about Cal Newport's

lifestyle-centric planning

 lately after a segment in his podcast. I have to think really high level and vague about that lifestyle to do it, as the realities of my current situation--family, house, all the costs associated with both--make it hard to imagine a simpler life, especially financially.

It was [this question and answer](https://youtu.be/nSkw2SO3esk?t=2239), specifically at the end of the segment where he talks about iteration as it relates to lifestyle-centric planning.

I'm on iteration 3, maybe 4, but sometimes I feel like iteration 1 or 2 was actually what I wanted and I fell away from that, specifically to have a family. Which I don't begrudge.

I also feel like old-fashioned retirement is my lifestyle-centric plan, then I'm just like some FIRE nut-job sheering my own sheep and collecting rainwater in the city.

I just want more time to read, think, and create. When Cal says "iteration 4 where you're on the houseboat creating art or writing your novel..." that rings true, but that also just sounds like retirement for a mid-pack thinker and writer like myself.

I recently got a lot of reading done while I was immediately recovering from my hospital stay and couldn't exercise. Now that I've picked back up exercise I'm reading less, because in the evenings when I would read, I'm exhausted from having woken up early and exercised (the

 doesn't help).

I recently got all the guitars out and revisited a song, but at this point all the guitars need work and so it's like the changing the lightbulb where first I have to get the guitars to the shop, which requires finding a moment during the week when the shop is open, which takes weeks because I work (or commute to/from work) for the duration of any shop's open hours.

Same for the new bike and trying to get the fit dialed in. I might have to schedule with [old bike fitter] for a Saturday but it will probably take weeks if not months to get in with him. [New bike fitter] is only available during the week.

I feel like I've said "no" to all the things already, and those are the things in my lifestyle-centric plan. I've put those aside to spend more time with family, raise kids responsibly, provide for them, be a good employee, and learn the things I have to learn to advance in my job. We're back to "it's just retirement"
