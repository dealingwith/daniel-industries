Barlow saw it coming while he was tending the soybean crop. Dismayed and surprised he didn't see it sooner, its form bobbing around the scrub bush surrounding their homestead about a football field away, he cursed and started back for the house with only his hoe in hand. It had been the better part of a year since they'd encountered one, and he had become lax in regards to scavenging ammo, although his weapons stockpile was still by the front door, the shotgun he would need was easily accessible. The question was: how many more were behind this one?

When the plague started, Barlow somehow managed to get his family out of the city. Those were stressful times, the infected and the survivors were all potential enemies, everyone just trying to make it another day, competing for increasingly scarce resources. They somehow made their way into west Texas and to an abandoned house nestled within a few mature trees, with very little else as far as the eye could see. For the first few months, his time was dominated by fighting off the groups that came across the high plains. He would make supply runs, scavenging for ammo and gasoline, and they started their first subsistence crops close to the house.

After the frequency of the hoards diminished, he managed to get a small windmill running, just enough to get the well operational. They had to ration the water between the crops and their own needs. His first bath in months was euphoric. In these last months, as they settled into a routine and the constant fear subsided, things had almost started to feel normal.

He stepped inside the house and shouted, "One's coming! Shut the windows and lock the doors!" and grabbed the shotgun and shoved a handful of shells into his pocket. He'd only seen the one but knew better. By the time he walked back to the edge of their fields, it was almost there on the far side, dragging a leg through the dirt. Barlow walked purposefully towards it. It saw him and gurgled its growl. It had traveled a long way without any chances to fulfill its demonic intentions.

Barlow waited until he was in point-blank range, then sent both shells straight into the creature's face. Its head exploded and its body instantly fell to the ground. He scanned the distance.&nbsp;

He heard the windows slamming shut, the deadbolt on the door closed so hard he could discern the sound from that distance.

He scanned the horizon. Was that movement or just heat waves?
