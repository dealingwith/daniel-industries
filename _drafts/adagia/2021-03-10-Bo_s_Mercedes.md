Bo's Mercedes was towed. He hadn't paid it much attention since before the big winter storm, and someone finally called the cops and they tagged it and towed it. Fuckers.

"They towed my car. Can you see about getting it back?" Bo never said hello or asked how anyone was doing. He just started in on the purpose of the call.

"Yes, sir. No problem."

"Great, thanks." Bo hung up.

He'd just taken four bags of trash and acrylic plaques to the trash bins in the ally. That's when he noticed the absence of the car. After he hung up, Bo went to the closet and pulled two large suitcases from its topmost shelf. He flopped them on the bed and threw them open. He opened a dresser drawer and began tossing clothing into one of the bags. The two suitcases were obtained to hold all of his clothing. He'd bought them back when he would travel and not know when he might get to return. Sure, he could have his clothes washed and folded while he was on the road--and he did--but that took time and he typically wouldn't have any time, particularly during the day when the cleaners were open. And his assistant's virtues were hampered by the fact he was suddenly a couple of timezones away.
