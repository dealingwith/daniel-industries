At work we all have our own pages in Roam and in them we write a "How to work with [me]". There was no template or suggestions although we all stole ideas from each other as to what to put in this section. This is a part of mine. I'm curious what yours would be like.

- Communication Style

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Internal first. Like most introverts, I have to think something before I say it. [Lauro described this well](((5Te0mJv2v))).

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Please provide as much specific context as possible. I don't have as much context as the rest of you have yet. üêô

&nbsp; &nbsp; - I don't tend to respond well to "everything's terrible". Let's break down the problem and start addressing it rationally.

&nbsp; &nbsp; - If something \_\_is\_\_ on fire, however, frequent, clear communication is paramount.

- Methodologies

&nbsp; &nbsp; - [Agility not Agile](http://www.daniel.industries/2019/06/27/agility/)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - "...teams should adopt the principles of agility. Agility, as I‚Äôve noted here many times before, is, to quote the agile manifesto, responding to change over following a plan. Truly agile teams enjoy the ability, desire and safety to respond to change over following a plan."

&nbsp; &nbsp; - You'd never know it, but I'm pretty cynical about [processes](http://www.daniel.industries/2018/03/11/product-camp/) being any kind of panacea for operational excellence. My personal philosophy is "as little process as is necessary".

&nbsp; &nbsp; - My most often-applied mental models:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's\_razor), "the simplest explanation is usually the right one"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's\_razor), "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory\_of\_constraints), "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s\_law), "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."

&nbsp; &nbsp; - "[Kill the Hero Programmer](https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/)"
