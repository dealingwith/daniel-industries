Margery's cat was named Papa Smurf. Her other cat was named Popcorn. Her other cat was named Fleabag (for obvious reasons). Her other cat was named Daydream. Her other cat was named Sleepy. The rest of the cats didn't have names.

Margery had a cat in high school. Her parents got her and her sister the cat when she was in elementary school. Margery got a cat of her own in her 30's. She got another cat in her 40's. She got 10 more cats in her 50's.&nbsp;

Margery was a light sleeper due to nightmares. She had nightmares about fish talking about their feelings. Nightmares about TV dinners turning into monsters. Nightmares about the big oak in her yard falling onto her house and not getting any insurance money for it because the insurance company deemed it an "act of God". Nightmares about getting bad grades in elementary school. It had been 50 years since she was in elementary school. Nightmares about being stuck in a corn maze and the sun setting and having to sleep in the cold cornfield overnight and seeing glowing eyes in amongst the rows. Nightmares about the middle-school bullies who snuck into the adjoining neighborhood to smoke making fun of her acne.
