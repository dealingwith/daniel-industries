"Wow I've never seen a priest smoke before. Especially not Camel regulars."

"Or known a priest who played in a Led Zeppelin cover band."

"Holy shit! You must be the coolest priest ever!"

"Cigarettes, Guinness, and sex with my girlfriend. These are my only vices. I

"And the Zep'?"

"I have it on the highest authority that Jimmy Page is Jesus' favorite

singer."

"Is that right?"

"It's partly the hair, of course. The sheolic production of \_Jesus Christ

Superstar\_ has been on hold awaiting his arrival. Omnipotent, trinitarian

beings make awful producers."

"Don't you kind of have to be a schizophrenic asshole to be in the musical

making business?"

"Or gay."

"Of course."
