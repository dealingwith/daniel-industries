"It actually smells really nice in here," Jeanie said.

Jimmy subtly took a deep breath in through his nose. "It doesn't smell like anything," he said and instantly regretted contradicting Jeanie.

"Yeah, I guess you're right!" she replied, nonplussed. "Ok, show me where the shitty stuff is!"

Much to Jimmy's surprise, Jeanie had taken an interest in his work. He told her about the chemical compounds they used to simulate the foul odors present in public restrooms. She wanted to experience them for herself so eventually he relented and invited her for a tour.

He walked over to a row of shelving that looked not unlike a giant toolbox. He pulled open a drawer and pulled out a glass jar with clear liquid inside. He brought it over to Jeanie and loosened the top. He allowed the top to open just ever so slightly. A few seconds later the smell reached their nostrils.

"Holy shit!" Jeanie proclaimed. Jimmy closed the jar.

"I told you," he said with a smile. "Now watch."

He walked over to a table a few feet away and proceeded to place a few drops of the liquid in a Petri dish. Then he put that jar back into its drawer and pulled out another jar with clear liquid inside. He drew some of it out with a pipette and walked back to Jeanie. He held the Petri dish up closer to her nose and she made a face that told him she could smell it. Then he put the liquid from the pipette into the Petri dish. The smell instantly dissipated. Jeanie's eyes widened.

"Wow!" she said.

"Pretty cool, right?" he replied. He'd never once thought of his work as cool. He wasn't sure why he suddenly considered it so now.

"Is there real shit in that stuff?" Jeanie asked.

"No."
