The social brand management agency had a catchy name displayed in a neon sign facing the door out to the coworking space. Some of it had stopped working so now it said "L ass". Nobody dared make fun of it. Baron had bought the sign just last year. Baron was the owner of the agency and leaked a sense of humor when it had anything to do with him or anything associated with him. He drove a red Mercedes Benz. He blared rap music as he sped into the parking lot and always backed into his parking space.

Jeanie always knew she had a knack for the internet. She always got the most likes on Instagram out of all her high school friends and when Tik Tok came out when she was in college she was the first person she knew on the platform. She loved buying ads for her clients. It was a game and each new ad for a client was like a new level. She had her dashboard set up just the way she liked it in her social media manager application. She had her performance notifications set up just so.

She was the first in the office each morning and the last to leave. Even Baron left before she did.
