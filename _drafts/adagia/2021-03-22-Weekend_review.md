I just finished a "weekly review"...a long overdue weekly review. I time-box my weekly reviews to two hours because otherwise I would be backlog swimming until dawn. I have a card (page) template in Notion:

- [] Time-block this time

**Paper inbox: 30min**

- [] Open unopened mail
- [] Capture any next actions
- [] Throw away what can be thrown away
- [] File what needs to be filed

**Email inboxes: 30min**

- [] Inbox Zero [I use [this technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ql1CQfxWxQ&t=327s)]
- [] Declare day of jubilee on newsletters
- [] Get anything with next action onto the board
- [] Grind through the rest
- [] Close email at 30 min

**Review boards: 60min**

- [] [Daniel Miller](https://www.notion.so/3859b567fda3464ea5a69d5ccb56274b) Inbox -- move all cards to appropriate place
- [] Groom the Backlog on [Daniel Miller](https://www.notion.so/3859b567fda3464ea5a69d5ccb56274b)
- [] Prioritize Backlog on [Daniel Miller](https://www.notion.so/3859b567fda3464ea5a69d5ccb56274b)
- [] Queue 14 tasks for this week in Up Next
- [] Process [Projects](https://www.notion.so/Projects-8558d397077d4eb685cdd74072172394) boards

Today I got to "Groom the Backlog". "Prioritize Backlog" is incredibly aspirational. I should remove that one. I'm going to do that right now. Done.

(There are 233 items still in the "backlog" after tonight's almost hour of grooming. I started with the oldest items this time, many of which were still very relevant.)

(I should have taken note of how many there were at the start. Somewhere between 250-299.)

I'm much worse about my paper inbox. I got through "Open unopened mail", although I did take care of a couple of those things in real time instead of just throwing them into that massive backlog. ðŸ˜‚
