George, I had no idea. No idea that you'd been through so much. You never talked about this stuff before.

What do you mean you don't think about it often? How can you not think about it?

Yeah, I guess it was a long time ago, but I'm scared you're just buring it. That you're just now telling me this after we've been together over a year!

I think you should see a therapist. No, hear me out. I think you should talk about this stuff with a professional.

I know you just want to finish your degree and ride your bikes. No, I won't leave it alone. If you want to be with me I need you to work through this stuff.

There&nbsp;_is&nbsp;_stuff to work through! Your dad! Your uncle, for fuck's sake. Your poor brother.

No, don't go to training until you promise me you'll think about it. Ok, good. I love you.

_Jesus, Genevieve, how is your boyfriend not a psycho? Is your boyfriend a psycho? How had none of this stuff come up before? I mean, I knew he'd passed but fuck, that story! And that uncle. He said he died too, and after all he'd done it was a relief. But he didn't tell me how he died. Again. Details, Genevieve. Pay more attention to the details._
