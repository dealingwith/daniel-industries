Today I had the best banh mi sandwich I've ever had. I'm not sure if I've had banh mi outside of Dallas but I know I've had a decent variety of them here. This was easily the best.

You start with the bread. The bread is the heart of any banh mi. It has to be good or else. This was perfect bread. Crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, delicious.

The ingredients on the menu are:

french cognac foie gras pâté, buttered mayo,

sliced jalapeños, pickled veggies, cucumber,

cilantro, vietnamese ham, shredded chicken,

grilled pork

Their pate sounds trying-too-hard fancy for pate but it is really good. Their ham, chicken and pork are all very high quality. The ratios of the ingredients was spot on.

It was one of those "each bit is a perfect bite" moments.

It was the highlight of an otherwise mediocre day.

Now I have to go back for whatever else they have on [their](https://www.ngonvietkitchen.com/) menu! After one more trip just for the banh mi, maybe.
