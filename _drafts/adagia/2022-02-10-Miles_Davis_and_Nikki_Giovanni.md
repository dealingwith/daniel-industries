The other night I decide to go hang out with my daughter, who is zoned out watching stuff on her iPad for too long. I say, "Let's read!" and break out my phone to see what books I have on there that we could read together.

"You don't have any good books. You only have books for grown-ups," she says.

I spot Bicycles by Nikki Giovanni and say, "Let's read poetry!"

We read SHOE JAZZ BLUE JAZZ and I ask Google to play Miles Davis.

Now we're reading poetry while we listen to Miles Davis.

It is sublime.
