Jack's uncle always gave him $10 for his birthday. Jack's dad harbored a giant resentment over the practice. Jack's dad knew his brother had money. They'd both inherited the same amount from their father. Jack's dad threw elaborate birthday parties for Jack at their ample house and would always get one big present to go along with the pile of more normal gifts.

One year it was a water slide bounce house. Another it was a motorized tank. A PlayStation. A BB gun with a sniper sight. One day it would be a car.

The real reason Jack's dad was resentful was because Jack always liked the $10 bill more. Jack's dad would spend 10 times that amount every week on sporting equipment and team fees and camping trips and random bullshit to entertain Jack, but Jack held that Jefferson like it was a gold bar. He kept them stacked in a drawer in his desk, crisp and neat. Jack didn't keep anything that neat. The tank got left out in the rain and didn't move anymore. The PlayStation ignored. The BB gun left in the corner after Jack wasn't allowed to shoot it over the neighbor's roof.

But give Jack a measly $10 bill and he'll cherish it forever. Maybe he'll be a banker one day.
