Greta woke up and realized she couldn't procrastinate picking up the dogs' poop any longer. She could smell it from the sunroom. She poured a cup of coffee and put some rollers in her hair. She grabbed the box of poop bags, sighed, and walked out the back door.&nbsp;

Pull out bag, put bag over hand, bend over--careful!--pick up poop with bagged hand, invert bag carefully, tie bag, place bag in pile, repeat.

By the end of it, she had about ten bags in the pile. She contemplated throwing them into her own trash can for a minute but thought better of it. There was a park right across the street with a trash can. Greta normally threw the dog droppings in there so her own can wouldn't stink. She shuffled across the street, poop bags in hand, the morning sun casting rays through her hair rollers.

She thought about the day ahead. Bible study that morning. The rally that afternoon. They needed to get the election overturned soon, before that Biden gave away all the money to undeserving parasites. Using the public's resources like that should be a crime!
