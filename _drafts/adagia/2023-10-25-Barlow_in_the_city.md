At this point, Barlow had become pretty adept at rummaging through houses for keyfobs and his short prayer for gas in the tank as he started up a car. He had just got one running that had three-quarters of a tank, they hadn't seen a zombie in a few hours, his wife was in the passenger seat, and his two kids in the back seat. There was a stuffed animal and a slew of fast food wrappers back there. His daughter inspected the stuffed animal. His son whined about wanting a Big Mac.

The streets were dark. So dark. The headlights of the car were the only light, and he constantly scanned within their perimeter for movement. He drove fast but not too fast, but ready to floor it in the case a mob appeared. He spotted something sparkling on the road, but couldn't recognize it until it was too late. He slammed on the brakes but the car still rolled over the small spikes, blowing out three of the four tires. Humans, healthy humans, jumped out of the bushes by the road, shouting.

The negotiations were brief and the bandits were relatively merciful. Barlow and his family left everything they had and were allowed to run. His wife was in tears. He was in disbelief. Were there really no honest people left? They were all either trying to kill them or rob them. They kept their children between them, running as fast as the kids could. They darted down the nearest alley. The street was too wide and exposed. He knew there wouldn't be much in this neighborhood, those people would have seen to that. They'd have to get a few streets down at least. He hoped they would remain alone.
