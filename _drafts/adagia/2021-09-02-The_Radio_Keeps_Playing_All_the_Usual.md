"What's a 'wonderwall', anyway?"

"Wonderwall was a 1968 British psychedelic film with a soundtrack famously composed by George Harrison. I thought you would have known that."

"I'm more of an _All Things Must Pass_ person."

"Ah."

"But, so, like, 'You're going to be the one that saves me, after all, you're a 1968 British psychedelic film'?"

"No, not like that.&nbsp;_Wonderwall Music_, the soundtrack album, was the first solo record by a Beatle."

"Ah, so, like, 'You're going to be the one that saves me, after all, your my version of stepping out from within the shadow of something I'm a part of that's so big and all-encompassing that having my own identity outside of it is scary and almost unfathomable.'"

"Precisely!"

"I would think Fran Healy would have known that."

"I mean, you didn't."

"Yeah, but I'm not a professional musician."

"Fair. Maybe he just doesn't like the sitar."

"What's not to like about the sitar? It makes me think about that amazing vegetarian place inside the Hare Krishna temple."

"Aw, that place is amazing."

"Better when I was younger and could really take advantage of the buffet."

"Yeah."

"Totally worth the colonic effects."

"Yeah."
