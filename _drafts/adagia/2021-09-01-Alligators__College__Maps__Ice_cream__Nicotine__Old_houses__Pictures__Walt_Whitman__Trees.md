As Viola's arm crunched within the clamped jaws of the alligator and it started its death roll, many images flashed before her eyes.

She remembered visiting the University of Florida with her dad. He refused to use the GPS, read his road atlas wrong and made them late for Prospective Incoming Freshmen Orientationâ„¢.

She remembered the old house in Pensacola they lived in when she was a teenager. Its uneven floors creaked and the whole thing looked like it was going to blow away in the next hurricane. Even the pictures never looked straight, no matter how many times she adjusted them.

She remembered her first cigarette, from James, whom she was trying to impress as they stood in the woods just behind their junior high school. She remembered thinking that it tasted weird. She remembered wanting another one immediately afterward.

She remembered reading Walt Whitman under a tree in her backyard.&nbsp;

> _Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,_

She never did get Whitman.

She remembered her dad buying her ice cream when she was three.

Then she felt her head slam against the muddy river bottom.
