I just woke up, made coffee, fed the cat, made my protein oatmeal, put on a bike racing live stream (the Tour de la Provence), and started doing some email. Not bad so far. I'm going to church in about an hour. I'm going to ride my bike after I get back from church. I have my weekly programming instruction with my 11-year-old protege after that, and I'm going to watch the Super Bowl with my football-obsessed 8-year-old son.

...

My wife just woke up and demanded cuddles before she emerged from the bed. Often when I'm fully caffeinated and I have an agenda (like getting into the shower so I can make it to church on time) I am a little on edge during these moments. On edge during cuddles! How silly. Today I somehow internally decided to enjoy the moment.

...

I was late for church.
