title: I need a task app to manage my task apps

- I'm now trying [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) and [Routine](https://routine.co/) on top of Notion for tasks. Routine somehow crossed my desk a few weeks ago and it's been helpful for planning my day, but with my main task management in Notion, and its Notion integration (which, I don't know how that works in the first place) doesn't work in the browser, and the only desktop app is for Mac. Notion does seem to be the only integration it offers. Marvin only offers email-to-Marvin, and API, Zapier, and calendar sync, which isn't bad, but I'm not sure how I would integrate Notion. Notion's flexibility is problematic with integrations. I could try to pen my own.

- But trying both Marvin and Routine simultaneously is certainly problematic. I might put Routine down while I'm re-trialing Marvin. Marvin is running a sale on annual plans which is why I'm trying it again. I even contacted them to have my trial re-upped from years ago.

- I do like having habits as a separate thing inside Marvin, but right there with my other tasks. In Notion, I have a single page template with a todo list with said habits. It keeps them from being in front of me at all times and requires I open that page just to check off a habit. (But at least it's not a separate app. I used to use a separate app.) But Notion doesn't provide any data around habits, which Marvin does.

- Marvin also provides both a weekly and daily planning functionality. That's the thing I'm looking for that Notion doesn't adequately provide. (And Routine and Marvin both do.) It has the timeline view, which I've tried, but that doesn't quite get it done the way I need it to.

- But getting all my tasks out of Notion and into Marvin is going to be rough. The thing I like about Notion is also the thing I don't like. That is, each task is a document in which I can put anything, including in-app links to other documents.

- Logseq, meanwhile, is doing me a little wrong by dropping support for direct GitHub integration. Every time the browser reloads it drops my connection to GitHub, and even after I re-establish the connection, it displays a huge message at the top of the app about said deprecation. I just switched to their desktop app, which doesn't install like a normal app on Linux. And it of course requires me to manually commit and push my files to my Github repo. I could set up a chron job for that, but meh.

- I've closed the Routine tab for now. If I was on a Mac it might win, but alas. It has some minor aesthetic things I didn't like. But then again so does Marvin.

- Marvin has an Android app, and supposedly a Linux app (which I'm sure is Electron or similar) but the latter refuses to download. Notion's mobile apps are pretty bad.

- As always I'm overthinking everything. I'm just obsessed with task planning ergonomics.
