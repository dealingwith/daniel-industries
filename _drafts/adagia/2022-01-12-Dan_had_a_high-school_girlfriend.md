 last spring but didn't go to college like all his friends. He just kept his job at&nbsp;

 stocking shelves at night. He found some new friends, other guys who didn't go to college. They would go out on the weekends, drive around until they found a low-traffic spot or an abandoned building, and drink.

Dan had a girlfriend. She was still in high school. She was a senior but wasn't interested in the senior high school stuff. She had an older boyfriend. Her friends thought it was cool and her enemies thought it was creepy.

Dan and his girlfriend would hang out in the empty efficiency above his parents' garage and do the things boyfriends and girlfriends do. His parents wouldn't let him move into the empty efficiency but they turned a blind eye to the fact he was&nbsp;

 in the empty efficiency.

If Dan's parents let him move into the apartment, that would be an admission that he wasn't going to go to college. That his stocking job at Publix was an acceptable adult occupation. That dating a girl you could technically go to jail for sleeping with was ok.
