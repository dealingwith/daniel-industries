"Hey, Gino!" the kids used to say in fake Italian accents just before they'd beat him up in the corner of the playground where the teachers couldn't see. Gino wasn't Italian. He didn't have any Italian anywhere in his genealogy. The bullies just thought his name sounded like a gangster's name, but he was skinny and a nerd so they enjoyed beating him up.

Well, now he was going to show them. They wanted gangster, they were going to get gangster. Suzy was getting married. Suzy had been and remained one of those girls who could be friends with everyone, even sworn enemies, and they wouldn't hold it against her. Gino got an invite, and he knew all those assholes had, too. He arrived loaded to bear under his too-big sportcoat.

The ceremony was short and sweet. Suzy cried through her vows. The food at the reception was ok but plentiful. The first dance was one of those things where they started off slow dancing and then there was a big bass note and then a fast beat and they started dancing like crazy and everyone flooded the dance floor.

Gino found himself getting into it and the sweat under his coat became unbearable. He took it off without thinking and hear someone shout, "Gun!"

Then he was laying on the dance floor, the bright lights bouncing off the disco ball into his eyes, a big fat bully pinning him down.
