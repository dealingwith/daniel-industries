To say Mrs. Dempsey was stereotypically beautiful would be an understatement. She was stunning. Even Norah, who considered herself self-confident and was rarely ruffled by other women, found her intimidating. The sounds of Greg and Mr. Dempsey laughing carried down the hall from Greg's office into the lobby, and Mrs. Dempsey turned in that direction without slowing. Norah thought for a moment that if she'd attempted such a pivot in heels that high, she would sprain an ankle.&nbsp;

"Mrs. Dempsey," she called out. Mrs. Dempsey did not acknowledge her. She didn't even slow down. "It's good to see you!" Norah continued.&nbsp;

"I wish I could say the same," Mrs. Dempsey's voice matched the content of her words. She was making no attempt at pleasantries. "I hate this place."

"Me too," Norah replied with a slightly sarcastic tone in her voice. She'd jogged across the lobby and caught up to Mrs. Dempsey, who finally stopped and turned.

"I'm going to speak with my husband," she told Norah. "If you'll excuse me."

"He's in an important meeting. Let me go get him," Norah said. Just as she'd finished the lie, more laughter erupted down the hall.

"I can hear that. I'll find him myself, thank you." With that, Mrs. Dempsey continued her speedwalk in the direction of her adulterine spouse.

Beaten in the brief verbal volley, Norah just stood and watched. It made her think of her own lover.
