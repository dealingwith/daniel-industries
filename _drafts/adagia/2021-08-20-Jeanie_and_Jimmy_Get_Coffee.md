Jeanie swiped right. Jimmy's name sounded like hers, she liked his dark but ethnically vague complexion. "Chemist" sounded like an interesting job.

Jimmy swiped right. Jeanie was hot. "Social brand manager" sounded like an interesting job.

They talked easily over coffee. Jimmy picked the spot, it was in the design district adjacent to the industrial area where he worked. He hoped it made him seem cool to know about such a spot. It was actually a roastery but they had a tiny coffee bar and some outdoor seating.

Jimmy was so nice, she thought. And cute. "How did you find out about this place?" she asked.

"Oh, I work right down there," he said, regretfully.

"Oh, yeah! Where do you work? We haven't talked about that yet." Jeanie had talked a lot about her job already.

"Oh, it's just a place over here." Jimmy regretted the extra shot in his latte and his brain scrambled around for a way to misdirect the conversation.
