Tom preferred to get angry over communicating his feelings. This was probably because he didn't know how to communicate his feelings. Like most American males, he was instead taught how to get angry.

Tom could feel hurt at the most minor of slights. He would get angry at anything beyond that. Ignore his pleas for sane use of shared resources? All-out war. Disrupt his day and act like it's your privilege to do so? You might as well declare WWIII.

Tom didn't like feeling this way. He just wanted people to show the tiniest bit of respect towards him, to make him feel like his presence in the world mattered. But he couldn't shake the feeling that it just didn't, that if he disappeared tomorrow everyone would just immediately move on. He felt this way despite evidence to the contrary. People loved him despite his anger. Sometimes they even loved him because of his anger, because somehow, deep down, they knew it was because he wanted things to be set right. Because sometimes it was righteous anger against those people doing the wrong things in this world.

Tom's anger caused him to frequently feel stuck. Letting go of the anger felt like acquiescence to those wrongs. Holding onto the anger was just a recipe for continued misery.
