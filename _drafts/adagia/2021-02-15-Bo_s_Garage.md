During the Great Snowpocalypse of 2021, the idea that Bo couldn't leave his garage apartment drove him mad. He hardly ever left his garage apartment anyway, but now that he&nbsp;_couldn't_ leave, it made him very angry. And he was down to cold cuts and Folgers coffee.&nbsp;

Bo only drank Folgers at home and only drank six-syllable Starbucks coffees when not at home.

He had some tea. He had no idea why he had the tea. He hated tea.

He found some mustard for his flat, circular meat slices. A wave of gratitude for the condiment was quickly replaced with rage as the mustard water covered the first slice. He'd been so overjoyed he'd forgotten to shake the bottle.

Other than the lack of food delivery availability, Bo's life wasn't impacted by the city shutdown. He did only one thing differently: he frequently went to the window and stared out at the snow and the icy street and longed to go somewhere else. The quiet beauty of the white blanket of snow was lost on Bo. It was only an external representation of the internal restrictions he lived with every day. Only this day, he&nbsp;_was_ going to go outside. If only this storm hadn't rolled in.

Then the kids started sledding down the hill next to his garage apartment. Right down the middle of the street. Bo cursed them from behind his window and returned to his couch.
