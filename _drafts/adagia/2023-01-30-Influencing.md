8:00 AM: Wake up. Check stats on yesterday's video. Boil water. Flip breaker. Finish boiling water. Make coffee.

8:30 AM: Write script for today's video. Walk out into woods to pee. Finish writing script for today's video.

9:00 AM: She starts to wake up. Boil water. Flip breaker. Finish boiling water. Make coffee for her.

9:30 AM: Go for a walk because she's getting herself ready and takes up all the room in the van.

10:00 AM: Begin filming today's video. A 5-mile hike to a beautiful waterfall. Show her her lines. Get equipment ready. Take Instagram photo of knolled equipment. Get equipment stowed in backpack.

10:30 AM: She's already forgotten her lines. She's forgotten the entire theme of the video. Get in argument. Wait as she stomps off into the forest and pouts for 30 minutes.

11:00 AM: Resume hike. Fake smiles.

12:00 AM: Arrive at waterfall. Realize there are way too many people here to get through the planned shot list. Get into another argument. Find a spot to shoot without a dozen people in the background. Get shots of her talking. Get b-roll shots.

1:00 PM: Realize you're both starving. Eat Cliff Bars. Realize you're still both starving and there is no food here, or back at the van, or anywhere within 10 miles of the van.

2:00 PM: Arrive back at the van. Scour Google Maps for the closest place to eat.

3:00 PM: Eat at Arby's. Determine to eat dinner somewhere worthy of Instagram and some shots worth putting in today's video. Check stats on yesterday's video. Curse the weekends for their low view counts.

4:00 PM: Start driving to next location.

6:00 PM: Pull off onto a dirt road to get a good shot of the sunset from a bluff in the distance. Almost get stuck driving the van through a wash that intersects the dirt road. Curse repeatedly and loudly, driving her to tears. Pass her tissues.

7:00 PM: Catch the last few minutes of the sunset and waste the SD card space on it anyway.

8:00 PM: Get back onto the main road.

9:00 PM: In a desperate attempt at calories and footage, stop at an old roadside diner and order half the menu. Take photos and videos of all the dishes. Eat a few bites of each, realizing none of it is any good but knowing you'll take that knowledge to the grave. Shoot a closing shot of her smiling in front of the diner, talking about its unique charm.

11:00 PM: Pull into camping spot.

12:00 PM: Start editing.

2:00 AM: Start video upload. Fall asleep before brushing teeth or washing face.

8:00 AM: Wake up.
