I don't remember exactly why I was in that neighborhood. I was just exploring. The house stood out. It was old, but still much newer and much larger than the other homes in the neighborhood. There was a gaggle of artistically-dressed people outside the nondescript door, most of them looked to be in their 20s, maybe a few in their 30s. One saw me as they started through the door like rocks through a funnel and grabbed me by the shirt sleeve. "Come on!" she entreated. For some reason I obeyed.

Through the door was a courtyard, the inner walls of the house were the same as the outside--just red brick with some concrete adornments. The ground of the courtyard was also almost entirely red brick. The house must have taken up half the block, the courtyard itself was probably as big as one of the bungalows next door. "Whose place is this?" I asked the woman who had invited me in. The entire crowd was talking all at once, each over another. They wore shirts with fluffy sleeves, white, purple, and red. Their pants contrasted with their tops. They were adorned with costume jewelry. They all wore heavy makeup, even the men.&nbsp;An odd chemical drug smell wafted from them. I felt like I was about to be the sole audience member of a musical. Maybe The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

"Oh, it's his," she said, and pointed up to a metal platform outside a second-story door, at the top of a set of stairs made of the same black metal. The man on the platform was dressed like a baroque clown. He was waving at the crowd. It was impossible to tell if he was smiling under the giant smile painted on his face. "You should meet him," she said and shoved me in that direction.

I don't know why I complied. I started for the stairs. He started for the door. I followed into the room, and as I entered, he was leaving through a door in the opposite corner. She was right behind me. "He inherited the place from his mother. She was very famous and successful. He's having a hard time holding onto the place. The bankers..." She trailed off.

I walked through the opposite door which revealed a long hallway. I saw him disappear around a corner at the end of the hallway. I walked down the hallway, past old white doors. One door was open. Inside was a dusty couch and a bookshelf with a turntable. A large stuffed animal sat in the corner. It looked like Totoro but wasn't. I could tell it was older than that.

It was about that time that I realized I was lost inside a stranger's house.
