[Man, sitting on floor, in front of laptop computer, arranging something on the floor next to him. Backpacks surround him. He appears to be in a conference center of some kind.](https://flickr.com/photos/smallritual/185161362/in/album-72157594192288635/)

I miss conferences. I miss SXSWi (where the above linked photo was taken) before it got even bigger and weirder (in the not-good-weird way). I miss [the XOXO festival](https://daniel.industries/2012/09/23/xoxo/), those first three years I was able to attend. I miss the energy of like-minded people, the optimism, the output that represented so much work and creativity.&nbsp;

I'm terrible at conferences. I'm introverted. I feel other. The last year I went to XOXO I went by myself and it was a very lonely experience. So I'm a little surprised that I miss them.

The closest I've gotten to that good conference experience was the Echo and Narcissus writing club, while it lasted.
