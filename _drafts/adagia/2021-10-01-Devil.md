The happy-go-lucky husband.

The doting, bookish wife.

The old school friend, freakish, scary, unpredictable. She just wanted a unique garment. She wanted to stand out. That silly man wrote that catchy song about her.

Her two men, honest folk, just trying to do their jobs.

And two dogs caught in the middle with their fifteen children.

And what must have been a metric ton of dog shit.
