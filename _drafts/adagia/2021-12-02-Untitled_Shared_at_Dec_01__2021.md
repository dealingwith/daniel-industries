I'm currently reading 5 related nonfiction books. Two for book clubs. One is a book club I started. To which I was super late tonight.

I mentioned a couple in my list the other day. But the 5 are:

- _The Second Mountain_ by David Brooks. Not sure yet if I would recommend this one, but it's about finding one's purpose in life, basically.
- _honest advent_ by Scott Erickson. This is the newest on the stack, via a book club my church is doing on it.
- _Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life_
- _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport. Have barely cracked this one but am already a big Cal Newport fan.
- _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius. I read a little bit of this one most mornings.

They all intertwine in a delightful way.

> ...people get stuck chasing their first idea, or the perfect idea, or that one big idea that will solve the problem, will be the answer, will dig them out of whatever hole they are currently stuck in.

--&nbsp;_Designing Your Life_

> Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them.

--&nbsp;_Meditations_

> May you receive the light of divine annunciation in the flames of your best-laid plans.

--&nbsp;_honest advent_

> You are trying to enact the same fall that is the core theme of this book--to fall through the egocentric desires and plunge down into the substrate to where your desires are mysteriously formed...That means you are looking into the unconscious regions of heart and soul that reason cannot penetrate.

I have another column on my "reading list" kanban board (yes, I know) -- "Started". That has 9 books in it._
