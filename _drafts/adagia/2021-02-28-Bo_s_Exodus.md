They sold the house. They sold the damn house. Those young little fuckers.

The sentences looped through Bo's head like a mantra. Bo needed to find a new place to live. The young couple had already moved out. Bo had to be out within a week. He hadn't started looking for a new place yet.&nbsp;

Bo's car hadn't moved since before the snowstorms. He wondered if it still started. He wondered if he was going to move any of his shit, or just fit as much as he cared about into the back of his Mercedez and put the rest on the curb.&nbsp;

Bo was just so angry that he was being forced to move. He wasn't aware of it cognitively, but it was emotionally reminiscent of his divorce. He was always more upset about the fact that she got the house than he was about the fact that she left him.

He could call the executive assistant at the office and have them look for apartments for him, his new bosses allowed him that one benefit. But his phone battery was dead and the charger was all the way across the room.

Bo reached over for a cold slice of pizza and contemplated his fate. What if he just didn't move?
