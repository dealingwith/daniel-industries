"Ты должен пойти с нами," the men said.

"You've got the wrong man," he said.

"Ты должен пойти с нами," the men said.

When they'd picked up Julie down the street, he smirked and picked some leftover sandwich out of his teeth. Served her right. He saw which sign she had in her yard during the last election.&nbsp;

"I'm telling you, you must have the wrong house or something."

"Mr. Johnson, Ты должен пойти с нами," one of the men said.

"No, I'm on your side. I voted for him. I've got his flag hanging right here in my living room." Mr. Johnson pointed to his right vigorously. The men did not move to look.

"Ты должен пойти с нами."

Mr. Johnson's voice cracked and its volume raised, "I'm. Telling. You. Guys. Please. I was there during the riots. I was right next to some of you guys. I have receipts, for fuck's sake!"

"Ты должен пойти с нами"

Mr. Johnson paused and looked at his feet. He sighed. He mumbled to himself, "Ok, I guess I have to go with them, but soon enough we'll sort this all out."

"Just let me grab a shirt," he said.

"Нет, ты должен пойти с нами сейчас," that one man said again.

Mr. Johnson sighed again. "Ok," he said.
