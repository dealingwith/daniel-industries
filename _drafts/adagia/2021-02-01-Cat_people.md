People said she was a cat person and they weren't wrong. They just didn't appreciate the extent to which she was a cat person. She wasn't a "cat person", as in, a person who really liked cats, or had a lot of cats, or fed the neighborhood feral cats, or all of the above. She was _literally_ a cat person like congressmen were lizard people. A shape-shifting creature from another galaxy sent here to rob the Earth of its natural resources and destroy all human life upon it. The cat people and the lizard people were in a race to extract the most value from this rich planet with its pathetic inhabitants. If it weren't for those damned lizards, she always thought, she'd be back home by now, lapping milk from fountains and napping on luxurious pillows. Maybe she would bring back some of these humans to rub her back for her whenever she demanded it. A feline can dream.

Instead, she was in a constant battle against the lizards, trapped in this human form. When the Transformers movies came out she just had to laugh. Alien robots turning into earth vehicles! Laughable. So close on the plot points, though, screenwriters. So close.
