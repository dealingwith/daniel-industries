I know it is going to be the longest ride I've done since last fall, before the surgery. I'm worried about my legs and my ability to absorb enough nutrients for over two hours on the bike. I wake up plenty early, have a good breakfast and two big cups of coffee. I overdress at first, but before I actually depart, I trade in my jacket for my lightweight vest, my medium-weight long-fingered gloves for my lightweight long-fingered gloves. I leave the toe covers behind.

I feel good and I'm pretty early. I also have to pee because of all that coffee. I pull into a coffee shop, the one in the lobby of the coworking space I used to work out of. The bathroom situation is a known factor. After once again achieving bladder comfort, I order an espresso and a vegan taco. I finish the taco long before my espresso is ready--the lady in front of me ordered the entire menu, it seemed.

As I'm riding through downtown, the friend who invited me on the ride pulls up beside me. We ride the rest of the way to the ride start--the downtown train station. There are about ten of us altogether, slightly more than what I'm used to, but on the other hand, I haven't made this ride in a long time.

The first part of the ride is uneventful. I notice I'm not feeling very tired or winded on the early climbs. I catch up with a couple of the guys--work, health, and family are the usual topics of conversation.

I take it easy on the first of the big climbs, grabbing a wheel I think I can stay with, and I do. I again notice that I'm not feeling particularly cooked by the climb, which historically has given me a lot of trouble.

We make our way to the next big climb. My strategy was the same, but suddenly I found myself in the front. Then off the front. This has never happened. I still don't feel particularly on the limit.

Losing weight really is the easiest way to get better at climbing.

I take a few fast turns at the front on the way back but at about halfway back I find myself at the back of the group and decide that's probably the move at this point. I'm not sure how my legs or my blood glucose are doing. I have another small bar.

I do make it back just fine. Now I have a little post-ride endorphin thing going on. It was a good day for a ride.
