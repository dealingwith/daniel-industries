New dark theme, eh? I like it.

We don't get much snow here in North Texas. Once every few years, maybe. And maybe an inch. Actually, usually less than an inch.

More often the temperature hovers between the thirties and sixty. Hoodie weather.

Yesterday I rode my bike with the in-the-forties kit. Thick wool socks, long sleeve jersey, lightweight vest, long-finger wool gloves, wool cap with ear coverings. It was forecast to get into the fifties, but not until later after we'd be done with our ride. Any rain in the forecast had been for earlier in the morning before we departed.

I only have a few additional pieces of kit for in-the-thirties. Toe covers, a wool long-sleeve mid-layer, a heavier, long-sleeve jacket, a gaiter, and thicker gloves.

Yesterday, soon after we turned back for home, about mile eighteen, it started to rain. I had been comfortable until then but the rain was cold. It soaked through my socks.

"[Rule](https://www.velominati.com/) #9" states, "If you are out riding in bad weather, it means you are a badass. Period." This is the good thing about finding yourself riding the back half of a thirty-six-mile bike ride in the cold rain.

It took a hot shower and another hour after getting home before my feet returned to normal. But I still felt like a badass.

Today it was right at fifty and dry. I rode in exactly the same kit but was nice and toasty.
