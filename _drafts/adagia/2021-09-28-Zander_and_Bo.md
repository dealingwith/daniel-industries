"I have an awesome idea," Zander said.

"Hit me," Bo enthusiastically replied.

"A service where we create custom newsfeeds--get this--on paper--for people and deliver them to their door every morning so they can read them away from their computer over mushroom coffee or whatever."

"Yes, everything is going analog! Brilliant, I love it!"

"Excuse me," said the anonymous gentleman at the next table, "but I couldn't help overhearing you. Did you say, 'Print out newsfeeds for people and deliver them to their door every morning?"

"Yeah!" Zander and Bo replied in near-unison.

"So you just invented the newspaper?"

"Newspaper!" Bo shouted, "That's what you should name it!"

"Yes!", Zander replied, "I hadn't come up with a name yet." He paused. "Wait, do you already have that domain or something?" he asked the stranger.

"No. A newspaper was an actual thing from the 17th century until about 20 years ago."

"Weird. What happened."

"People stopped caring about the news. They only cared about what their friends and people like them were up to. Also, they would read about that stuff on their phones."

"Wait, what's news that's not what friends are up to?"

"Like, world events."

"Oh."

"Oh!" Bo interjected, "Maybe we could create a thing that a person has in their apartment that can create the newspaper on demand!"

"Like a thing that would print it out?" Zander seemed intrigued.&nbsp;

"You just invented the printer," the man said and turned back to his phone.
