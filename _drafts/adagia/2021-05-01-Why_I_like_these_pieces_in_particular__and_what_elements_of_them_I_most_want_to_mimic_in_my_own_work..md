Gibson for sure coined the word cyberspace. I think he coined "the matrix", which the movie trilogy stole without embarrassment. He coined a **lot** of words in his books.

Gibson wrote about futuristic, difficult to visualize worlds, both the physical and the virtual. He flipped between those two. But he did so in extremely evocative ways and he quickly painted the scenes with words.

His writing is punchy.

His writing moves fast.

His plots are not straightforward or clear.

His worlds are immediately vast.

Gibson is a quintessential Gen X writer.

He combined his hyper-futuristic worlds with normal shit from the time in which he wrote. Analog televisions. Arcades. But it all makes sense. It doesn't make sense on the face of it, but while reading it it does, and it allows us climbing holds with which to make sense of his worlds.

His writing is gritty.
