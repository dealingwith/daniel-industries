Papa Smurf, Popcorn, Fleabag, Daydream, Sleepy, and the other cats needed food. And they needed litter. Holy God, did they need fresh litter. Marge had to get to the store. She'd never driven in these conditions before. Never before in all her decades of living in this town. The roads were still white. Covered in snow, and below that a layer of sheet ice. She bundled up with every layer she could manage and gingerly shuffled down the front walk to her sedan. She managed to pry the door open without much trouble. The car started, also with only minimal complaints. She cranked up the defroster and waited.

Twenty minutes later a swipe of the wiper blades moved the last of the snow and ice off her windshield and she was ready to get to the store. She pulled out of the drive carefully, going impossibly slow and taking the turn onto the street very wide.

The car crawled to the store and she parked in the parking lot, which was also just a solid blanket of ice and snow. The store was packed and had very little of anything. She grabbed all the litter and as much food as she dared. She knew giving the cats different food would only exacerbate the litter situation.

She waited to check out. And waited. And waited. Finally, she was able to check out. She pushed her heavy cart out the doors. She knew she'd never be able to push the now heavy cart across the snow, so she grabbed the nearest employee and asked if he would watch her cart while she pulled her car up.&nbsp;

Once she had brought her car up, the nice employee helped her heap the bags of food and boxes of litter into her tiny trunk. Now all she had to do was get back home and she'd be able to unclench.&nbsp;
