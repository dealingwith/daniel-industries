Despite clearly drinking a lot of coffee, and probably drinking a lot of other things, based on his vitals and his skin, he was still very handsome, and his teeth...his teeth remained perfect in every known way. Was he just obsessive about his oral hygiene? Did he win some kind of genetic lottery when it came to looks and teeth?

"What do you do?" I remember asking.

"I write," he replied, flatly.

"Oh? What are you working on now?" I asked, earnestly. I'd learned long ago to not ask patients if I might have heard of their creative endeavors because more than likely I had not.

"Well, I haven't been published in some time. But at the moment I'm writing a memoir."

"Well that must be interesting," I said without a hint of sarcasm, although in hindsight I can see how that is a somewhat inherently sarcastic response.

"Maybe. Depends on how many lies I tell."

"Nothing wrong with an embellishment here and there," I said as I opened my cleaning kit. The picks reflected the sun coming through the window.

"Embellishment would be a gentle word for it."

"Well, it's your life after all."

"How do you know I'm not ghost-writing?"

"Oh," I said, genuinely surprised at the prospect, which I had not considered. "Are you?"

"No," he said as I jammed a mirror and a pick into his mouth, ending the conversation.
