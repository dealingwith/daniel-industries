Janine worked in tweets like others would work in paints or clay. Her wit knew no equal. Each bit that gathered replies and retweets like a Nebraska corn harvester was orgasmic in the dopamine levels it could elicit.

Each post or thread was like a carefully crafted wartime propaganda piece, designed for immediate consumption by the hungry masses, searching for meaning wherever their meaning-starved emotional maws could find it.

Then one day Janine waded into the wrong part of that dark social media forest. She squeaked and glowing eyeballs appeared out of the darkness, all around her. She thought she could see sharp teeth glimmer in the faint moonlight that made it through the thick tree cover.

Her phone rang. She knew better than to pick it up, but she did anyway. Call it morbid curiosity.&nbsp;

"Is this R\*\*\*\*\*e R\*\*e?"

Her real name. She froze, breathless.

"Get ready to be"&nbsp;

She hung up instinctually. She probably should have waited to find out what it was she should be getting ready for, but she knew it was terrible and she knew she wouldn't really be able to prepare for it.

She deactivated her Twitter account. And the Facebook account she hadn't used in years. She searched the Wayback Machine for anything that might still remain with her real name on it.
