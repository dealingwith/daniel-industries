Treasure's mom was five feet eight inches tall and weighed 260 pounds. She drove a lot. Treasure's school, work, Treasure's after-school activities, second jobs, groceries, clothes, dollar store, city pool, cookout at the park. Treasure's mom knew the city better than the back of her hand. She knew it as well as Google Maps.

One day while pulling out of the small strip mall's parking lot, she saw a group of cyclists huddled around one bike with its wheel removed. A man bent over the detached wheel, wrestling with its tire. He looked up and caught eyes with her and said, "Hey, honey!"

She was appalled. And flattered. Also, "Hey, honey" was her line, not his. "Hey, sugar!" she finally said in reply.

"Hey," he said, "Which one of us do you think has the best ass?"

Now Treasure's mom really didn't know how to respond. She was glad Treasure was with her dad and not in the car.

Another of the group of cyclists said, "Oh my fucking god," and started to ride away. Another followed him.

Treasure's mom pointed at the cursing cyclist as he rode away. "That one," she said.&nbsp;

"Thanks," said the charming but rude cyclist as she pulled away, waving. People sure could be strange, she tought.
