> When I say I don’t like your idea, I’m not saying that I don’t like you. And if we’ve been persuaded by marketers and politicians that everything we do and say is our identity, then it gets very difficult to learn, to accept useful feedback and to change.

> Evolving our choices and our tastes is part of being human. Establishing your identity as someone who is not static, open to change and eager for better makes it far easier to engage in a world where some would prefer us to do precisely the opposite.

**-- Identity is often used against us** ](https://seths.blog/2021/04/identity-is-used-against-us/)

This rings true, and as the other side of the coin to my hot-take on opinions. "Establishing your identity as someone who is not static, open to change and eager for better makes it far easier to engage" period--as a giver and receiver of ideas, etc.

"Not static", much like the UI of this little web app. I don't get to visit very often, so it's quite fun to see it change between visits. I love the new landing page.

From late Friday night until this afternoon, I thought we were going to buy a new, much larger house. I spent far too much time running financial models to determine how we could make it work. In the end, we couldn't. Or wouldn't? In any case, the model-creation was a very useful exercise. Even really good real estate deals are hard to compare to plain ol' compounding interest in boring, relatively conservative investments. If the monthly mortgage, insurance, and taxes add up to less than your rent, or if living in that specific space will make you incredibly happy, sure...otherwise...meh. I think we might have avoided a big little money pit.
