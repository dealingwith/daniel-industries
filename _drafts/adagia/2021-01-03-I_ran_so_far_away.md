Jimmy loved to run. The better part of a decade earlier he was fifty pounds heavier and the only 4K he was worried about was his computer monitor. Now he was moving on from his fifth marathon to focus on an ultramarathon through the Appalachian woods.&nbsp;

When he started all those years ago, he could only make it around the block. Then he decided to push himself and went half a mile. He kept doing half a mile until he could go the three-quarters of a mile to the running trail at the lake. His knees hurt but he ran through the pain until they stopped hurting.&nbsp;

He ran his first 4K training route four months later. Two months after that he was PRing it every week. He entered his first race. People along the side of the road and in the race itself encouraged him. He felt part of a tribe. He had a new identity.&nbsp;

He changed his diet. He changed his sleep patterns. He ran in the extreme heat. He bought new clothes so he could run in the extreme cold. He ran in the rain. He ran as soon as the snow melted off the trails.

Some of Jimmy's old friends wondered what happened to him. They hadn't heard from him in a while. They didn't know that they weren't on the same path anymore, that trail that disappeared into the distance, solitary mile after solitary mile.
