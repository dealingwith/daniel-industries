"I'm not a fighter. I'm certainly not a killer." Tris was still waiting for his tea to cool off enough to sip and was blurting out his primary anxiety about this new “opportunity”. When he thought about sharing it with anyone, he called it an opportunity and used his fingers to make air quotes as he said it.&nbsp;

“Oh, no, Bunnymen never kill.” Bissell replied.

“What do you call that back there?”&nbsp;

“Those weren’t Bunnymen. Those were just those who protect us. The Horsefolk had been warned. They didn’t listen. It was a last resort.”

Tris considered the logic. “How often do you find yourself last resorting?” He realized his hands were slightly shaking. He only noticed when he attempted to pick up his tea. The action in the street had happened so suddenly that his brain was only now really processing it.

Dumplings were brought to their table. “I ordered us some food. I think you still need to eat breakfast. And not very often.”
