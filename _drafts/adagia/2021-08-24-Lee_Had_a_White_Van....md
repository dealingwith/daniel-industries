Lee had a white van but he wasn't a predator. He could stop kidnapping any time.

Lee's white van had windows. Sure, they were tinted nearly black, but he wasn't trying to hide anything.

Lee was a blackout kidnapper. He stopped reading the paper years ago because he never knew if a particular story was about him.

Lee kept himself isolated most of the time. Better safe than sorry.

Lee knew he had a lot of "yets". Hadn't been arrested _yet_. Hadn't been sentenced to death _yet_.

Lee just found certain people interesting. So interesting that he'd blackout and then read about them in the paper two weeks later. Body found south of town. That's why he stopped reading the paper.

Sometimes Lee would go weeks or even months without kidnapping. Then one day he would drive by a particularly interesting person. "I'll just follow them for 100 feet," he'd think. "Ok, just half a mile," he'd think after 100 feet.

Lee knew he should just get rid of that dirty trunk tucked in the corner of his backyard shed, on account of what was in there. But he couldn't bear to open it. Too many memories in there he couldn't remember.
