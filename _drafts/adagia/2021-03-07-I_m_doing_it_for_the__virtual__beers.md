I'm a sucker for badges and digital collections.

Yesterday was near-perfection. It started off watching Strade Bianchi live. [The images were stunning](https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/gallery-a-battle-of-the-stars-at-the-mens-strade-bianche/), as was the racing. Then, [I went on a 53 miles bike ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/4902596148). Then, I played Minecraft with my son for a while. Then we had dinner. Then our neighbors came over for a fire (in my [awesome fire pit](https://www.solostove.com/)) and s'mores.

I meant to ride this morning but apparently the ride yesterday wore me out because I slept in big-time, missing my window of opportunity for today. It looks like I'm good to ride every morning this coming week, however. Sundays are big Minecraft days. In just a few minutes I meet with my Minecraft U co-founder about our spring break camp plans. Then shortly after that, I have my weekly Minecraft coding session with my two proteges. Today we're going to be joined by a former instructor, now a professional software developer, to do some server admin.

Bikes and Minecraft. Big thumbs up.
