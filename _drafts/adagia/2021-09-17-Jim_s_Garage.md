Jim loved his detached garage. He didn't have a man cave. He had a garage. He had a sound system and a giant toolbox and a 1967 Mustang in there. In there he could experience peace.&nbsp;

Jim wasn't a particularly tech-savvy guy, but he loved tech. When he found out he could open his garage door with his phone, he had to have it. The technician was half his age and showed him the process with a sheen of condemnation.&nbsp;

It was months, maybe years, later when Jim rolled himself out from under his Mustang and decided to head back inside for the night. It was cold and he'd closed the garage door. He hunted for his phone on the workbench and finally found it. He tapped the screen but it just stared back at him with a cold, dark glare. He clicked the button on the side. Nothing. It must have run out of battery again.

The side door hadn't worked, ever. He tried it just to be sure, but it wouldn't budge. He put his shoulder into it. He hurt his shoulder.

Jim got up on a stool and took the cover off the garage door opener. He searched for a manual open button but found nothing.

He pulled on the door, but it wouldn't move. He wedged his car jack under one of the door braces. The brace bent but the door remained steadfastly closed.

"What the hell?" Jim finally asked nobody. He swore he heard a faint laugh.

Three weeks later the police pulled up on the outer garage door handle and it flew open. Jim's body was grey, his eyes covered in flies.
