My last customer of the day was the old drunk man who never left his typewriter. He had me come twice a week because he hated a dirty house but he hated cleaning more. The to-go containers and dishes would pile up because he literally never picked up anything. The rest was pretty easy given the frequency of my visits. A year ago when I told him I was raising my rates he just grunted. He's always paid on time. Square Invoices have practically changed my life. He might be old and live behind his typewriter, but the man can still use a smartphone. Not having to talk to him is magical.

When I got home my crazy cat lady of a neighbor was outside. I swear she has two dozen cats. They come and go from the house like cockroaches from a busted sewer pipe. She was putting out food for the feral ones she liked to attract to the neighborhood. They poop in my flower beds. Sometimes they attack her house cats and they scream at each other late into the night. I've called animal control on her after particularly sleepless nights but so far nothing.&nbsp;

I hope tonight isn't one of those nights. I want to watch Bridgerton in peace.
