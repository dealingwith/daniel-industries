He just wanted what they had, and she was clearly saying she was walking away from that. He had just talked to her, told her that he wanted more of that. He'd told her he loved her. It was true. She didn't say anything in response. He knew that was true, too.

He just wanted to be desired like that again, to desire like that again. He wanted to steal knowing glances across a room. He wanted to enjoy buying coffee for someone.
