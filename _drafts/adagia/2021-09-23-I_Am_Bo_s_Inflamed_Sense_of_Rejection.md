> By maintaining a personal museum of resentments, we imprison ourselves within it.

-- Russell Brand

> Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being.

-- Anne Danielewski

> Fuck those guys.

-- Bo

> He's angry. He knows the group is well-meaning and they try hard, but they don't get how things should work as well as he does. So he has to stay on top of everything, and the only way he knows how to get their attention, keep it, and make sure they get things done right is by getting angry. He is comfortable with his anger. It makes him happy. But when pushed too far, the top of his head bursts into flames.

-- Lewis Black, describing his character Anger in _Inside Out_

Bo had been wronged. Yet again. Was the entire world out to get Bo? Yes, yes they were.
