Jake's little brother, how are you doing? Last I heard you'd won some kind of championship. What was that called? Trials? What's that? Bicycles? Where you hop around over rocks and stuff? That's cool, I guess.

I remember when your father died. Damn shame, that. How old were you then, 15? Hell of an age to lose your father. I don't remember you crying, though. I don't remember any emotions on your face, come to think of it.

I remember when the farm got ruined. Jake sure took that hard. He was worried about you then, you know. He came to me and said, "What about George, where's he going to live?"

I remember you going to live with your aunt Melba and uncle Albert. I remember when they found Albert dead in the backyard. Then all those young men came forward and it was all over the paper how he'd touched them when they were kids.

Weren't you the first kid in your family to go to State? Or any college, for that matter? I think you were. That's right, you weren't nothing special in high school but State took you, and all of a sudden you were a star student. Chemistry, is it?

A bike-hopping-around chemist from State. Who'da thunk it.
