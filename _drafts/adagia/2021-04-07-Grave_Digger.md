They had to exhume a body before they could bury a new one. The government tried to encourage people to arrange for their cremation, but some people couldn't or wouldn't. The one-in, one-out policy was a secret, of course. He wondered for how long they could keep it.

Of course, there were machines for the job, but with the exhuming portion of the process, the last bits were still a manual process. No one wanted to crush the box with the machinery and expose the corpse. So down into the hole they would go with their shovels to throw up the last few cubic feet of dirt. This made him feel authentic, old-school. He liked to keep the sides of the hole as perfectly straight as he could. It was a Sisyphean task, as the dirt and gravity conspired against him.

They'd use straps and the machine to pull the old box out of the ground. They never said "coffin". It was always referred to as the box. Then they would lower the new box down. The virtual service had already happened, so there was nothing else to do but push the dirt back into the hole. He'd always scoop one shovelful by hand. He felt like it was the last bit of respect he could show to the dead.
