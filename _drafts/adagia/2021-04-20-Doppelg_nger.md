Douglas clicked on the tab containing Gmail and stared at his inbox and sighed. The thought of looking at these was exhausting. The energy it would take to process the information contained therein, to make any decisions that needed to be made, to capture any important information, to take any actions required by their intrusion into his life...

Douglas sipped his milk tea and clicked on the tab containing his todo list. The thought of tackling any of these made him want to take a nap. No joy was contained in this collection of things to be done. Tick the box. Tick the box. Tick the box. "Crank widgets." No, thanks anyway.

Douglas clicked on the tab containing his nonlinear note taking app of choice. He'd only made a few notes so far today. He turned inward trying to figure out something to write there. He returned from his trip empty handed.&nbsp;

Douglass looked across the ten other tabs open in his browser, contemplating either doing the thing they represented or copying that thing and their URL into his todo app.

It was already late. How did it get so late so fast? Where did this day go? Was this all there was to life, every day blurring by, Douglass standing by the side of the road with his thumb out, watching the traffic speed past?
