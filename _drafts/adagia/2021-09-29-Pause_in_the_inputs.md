I've had a couple of days without many new inputs. I'm hoping this trend continues for the rest of the week because I'm starting to dig myself out of the hole. I won't be able to dig myself out of the hole, mind you, but I'm starting.

Cal Newport calls this "[Confronting the Productivity Dragon](https://www.daniel.industries/2021/07/01/confronting-the-productivity-dragon/)". My dragon is of mythical proportions, even as mythical beasts go.

But at least I've pulled myself off the ground, grabbed my sword, and looked over at it again.

But now I need to sleep so I can continue tomorrow.
