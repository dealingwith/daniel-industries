Jack loved the local news. You could say he was obsessed with it. He watched every local station's local news station's morning and evening news programs. He followed them all on Twitter. He subscribed to various local news source's feeds and email lists.

Jack loved a good murder mystery. He waited every night for a story about a body found in the river, or a person who had disappeared. He'd take hikes on the weekends in the wooded areas where one might ditch a body,&nbsp; if one had a body they needed to ditch.

A couple of these mysteries, Jack tried to investigate. That was until the cops learned his name and first politely, then not-so-politely, asked him to mind his own business.

So Jack tried to stay one step ahead of them. Or he would snoop around the scene of a crime after they'd left. Mostly, he used the internet a lot.

Jack didn't have many friends. Just one or two, really. His parents had passed long ago. He lived by himself in a low-rent apartment near the bad part of town.

So it was with great surprise that he heard a knock on his door. It was with greater surprise that he found the woman standing at it.

"I heard you investigate murders and stuff," she said.

Jack paused. "Yes. Yes I do," he replied.
