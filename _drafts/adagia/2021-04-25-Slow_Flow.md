I just wrote a [blog post](http://www.daniel.industries/2021/04/24/slow-flow/) that is just chunky quotes from two different articles. I stopped short of writing my thoughts about how they relate because they're not well-formed. "Not well-formed thoughts?!" I thought, "Let's go write on adagia.org!"

I watch a lot of different YouTube channels, mostly bicycle-related or technology-related. But I occasionally watch channels of these hikers and camping enthusiasts and I know why: they move so slowly and deliberately and are not being distracted while they walk or strike camp or chop wood or start fires or cook dinners. The content is akin to "slow TV". Two of these channels are [Kraig Adams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnuadQ_w3r6f4Q_NRlqd-w) and [UPNORTHOF60](https://www.youtube.com/user/upnorthof60).

It's no secret that I'm a big Cal Newport fan even though I've yet to read his books, I consume his blog and his podcast regularly. I try to practice time-blocking whenever possible. I don't really spend much time on social networks. But I still feel constantly inundated by information, requests on my time, new tasks, new projects, new "fires" to manage. It's all my fault, of course. I could start fewer projects, fewer businesses, find fewer things interesting, have a less ambitious information diet.&nbsp;

But I watch these people go on hikes in the wilderness for days and feel a tremendous about of jealousy. I should plan some solo outings into the woods. Surely my family and my coworkers would forgive me.
