Johnny was so handsome. That was, for sure, the first thing I noticed about him, and the main thing I cared about at the beginning. But he was also smart and creative. Being with him made me feel smart and creative. And I liked his apartment. It was on the Upper East Side. His wife got it in the divorce, though.

He spent most of his time in his office at his typewriter. His office had big, dark wood bookshelves filled with books and papers. There were papers on every horizontal surface, and sticking out of the filing cabinet drawers. The ashtray overfilled with Camel Lights. The bottle of bourbon had lines drawn with sharpie along its side.

We'd go out to dinner every night. He would tell me how incredible I was. When his work sold we'd go to a fancier dinner. We'd go to the movies. On the weekends we'd go to the museums. During the summers we'd go to London and Paris.

But he never gave me what I really wanted--a child. It was like a black cloud over me, and I was only getting older. Eventually, I had to break free. I couldn't resist. I needed someone my own age. Someone with life still to give.
