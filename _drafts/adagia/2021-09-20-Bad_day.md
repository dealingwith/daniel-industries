I've had a weird day that started at 2:30 and climaxed with a trip to one of those small private ERs for an IV of fluids, pain meds, and anti-inflammatories. I just ate part of a cliff bar--my first solid food today. I wish it were all interesting enough for a retelling, but it's not.

The highlight of today might be this St. Vincent show that's live-streaming on Twitch right now. She's one of Dallas' best exports.

Not writing today.
