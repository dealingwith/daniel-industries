Tima hit enter on his post and stared at the loading ellipsis. Seconds passed. Nothing happened. He hit refresh. A browser error page was displayed. Something about DNS.

"Site's down," he said to his compatriot.&nbsp;

"I see that," his compatriot replied.

"What do we do?"

"I don't know. Wait?"

"I can't wait. I'm paid by the post. If I don't hit my quota today they'll find someone else. This is the only way I can feed my family."

"I hear you."

Tima was a front-line soldier in the war of disinformation. He was paid by the piece, like a factory worker in a third-world country, except his factory line was his computer and his factory was Facebook. If the factory went down, he didn't get paid.&nbsp;

Tima spent his day walking between the automatic espresso machine and his computer and hitting the refresh button on his browser repeatedly. His anxiety grew with each minute and with each espresso.

Finally, many hours later, the site returned. His shift was over. The next shift would take over his workstation. He would be paid very little today. Barely enough to cover his bus fare to and from the office.
