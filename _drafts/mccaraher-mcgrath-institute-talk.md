[Church Life Journal Lecture 2020, "You're a Slave to Money, Then You Die"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGVyGH2fgE4&t=1895s)

Eugene McCarraher, Associate Professor of Humanities at Villanova University, presents on "You're a Slave to Money, Then You Die: The Perverse Theology of Neoliberalism." This lecture hosted by the Church Life Journal, an office within the McGrath Institute for Church Life.The event took place on February 6, 2020 at the LaFortune Ballroom, Notre Dame.

## Summary

**Speaker:** Eugene McCarraher
**Venue:** McGrath Institute for Church Life (Church Life Journal Lecture, University of Notre Dame, Feb 6, 2020)
**Title:** *“You’re a Slave to Money, Then You Die: The Perverse Theology of Neoliberalism”* 

McCarraher argues that neoliberalism is not merely an economic doctrine but a **moral and metaphysical imagination**—a surrogate theology in which the market replaces God as the ultimate source of truth, order, and value. Drawing on intellectual history, film, political economy, and theology, he contends that neoliberalism sacralizes capitalism, subordinates democracy to markets, and reshapes human identity into entrepreneurial selfhood. The lecture culminates in a call for renewed moral imagination grounded in the Christian vision of human dignity.

# Outline with Section Summaries

## I. Opening Frame: *Network* and Corporate Cosmology

McCarraher opens with the 1976 film Network, focusing on Arthur Jensen’s monologue about a “holistic system of systems” governed by corporate power .

**Purpose:**

* Jensen’s speech dramatizes neoliberal metaphysics:

  > “There is only one holistic system of systems…” 
* Capitalism becomes the ontological structure of reality.
* Money functions as sacrament; the market as divine order.

**Core Claim Introduced:**
Neoliberalism is not just policy—it is an **eschatological narrative** and **corporate cosmology**.

---

## II. What Is Neoliberalism? Beyond Deregulation

McCarraher rejects the idea that neoliberalism simply revives laissez-faire capitalism. Instead, it seeks to:

* **Remake all of human life in the image of the market** .
* Transform democracy into something “market conforming.”
* Redirect state power toward expanding and protecting markets.

He emphasizes that neoliberalism **does not shrink the state**; it retools it to enforce market order (privatization, surveillance, militarization).

**Key Quote:**

> “The world is a business.” 

---

## III. Intellectual Genealogy: From the 1920s to Reagan

Drawing on historians like Quinn Slobodian and David Harvey, McCarraher situates neoliberalism as:

* A response to the rise of democracy and socialism after WWI.
* An attempt to “inoculate capitalism against the threat of democracy.”
* A political project to restore elite power.

### Major Figures

* Ludwig von Mises
* Friedrich Hayek
* Milton Friedman
* Margaret Thatcher
* Ronald Reagan

**Economic Effects Identified:**

* Wage stagnation
* Financialization
* Massive upward redistribution of wealth 

---

## IV. The Market as Ontology (Hayek & Mises)

McCarraher treats neoliberal theorists as covert theologians.

### A. Hayek’s “Cosmos”

Hayek describes spontaneous market order as transcendent, beyond human comprehension .

**Key Idea:**
Submission to the market resembles submission to providence.

> “Submission to the impersonal forces of the market… made possible the growth of civilization.” 

McCarraher calls this a migration of the holy—from God to the market.

### B. Mises and Pecuniary Rationality

Mises equates rationality with monetary calculation:

> “There would be no means of determining what was rational” without money .

Beauty, morality, and reason collapse into exchange value.

---

## V. Ayn Rand and Moralized Capitalism

Ayn Rand becomes the prophet of market virtue.

### Core Tenets:

* Money is “the barometer of virtue.” 
* Love is “spiritual payment.” 
* Charity undermines merit. 

Her novel Atlas Shrugged sacralizes the dollar sign as cosmic symbol .

**Interpretation:**
Rand transforms capitalism into a moral metaphysics of earned worth and contempt for the weak.

---

## VI. The Entrepreneurial Self

McCarraher draws on Philip Mirowski and Wendy Brown.

Neoliberal anthropology defines the person as:

* A portfolio of assets
* “Human capital”
* A brand

**Cultural Mechanisms:**

* Social media platforms as “technologies of the self”
* Market logic reshaping identity and personality 

---

## VII. The Punitive Culture

Neoliberalism fosters contempt for the weak.

Examples:

* Reality TV as theater of humiliation
* Militarized policing
* Demonization of unions

McCarraher describes a “punitive sateomorphism toward the poor” .

---

## VIII. Crisis and Possibility

He invokes Fredric Jameson:

> “It seems easier now to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.” 

Neoliberalism has paralyzed imagination. Resistance alone is insufficient—what is needed is a **positive alternative vision**.

---

## IX. Christian Counter-Vision: The Weight of Glory

McCarraher closes with C. S. Lewis and *The Weight of Glory* The Weight of Glory:

> “There are no ordinary people… You have never talked to a mere mortal.” 

**Contrast:**

* Neoliberalism: humans as capital.
* Christianity: humans as bearers of divine glory.

This theological anthropology undermines productivity as ultimate measure of value.

# Central Thesis in One Sentence

Neoliberalism is not simply an economic regime but a **surrogate religion** that sacralizes markets, subordinates democracy, commodifies human identity, and demands theological resistance grounded in the irreducible dignity of persons.

# Christian counter-vision: *The Weight of Glory* (thorough summary + ample quotes)

In the closing movement of the lecture, McCarraher shifts from diagnosis to **positive moral imagination**: if neoliberalism enchants us with the market as ultimate reality, then resisting it requires an *alternative* metaphysical and moral horizon—one that re-centers human beings as creatures of **irreducible dignity**, not “human capital.”

### 1) A hinge moment: empire’s decline as a moral opening

He sketches two futures as Americans confront the possible end of imperial self-certainty—either doubling down on denial and fear, or treating decline as a “liberating moment of possibility.” 

Key phrases he uses to mark the second possibility:

* “**accepting it with gratitude and even jubilation**” 
* “**wiser**” and “**freer to assess and rearrange our affairs**” 
* by “**more generous standards than productivity or technological innovation**” 

That last clause matters: he explicitly targets the neoliberal moral metric—*productivity/innovation*—as a false “standard” for judging a society or a person.

### 2) Why resistance isn’t enough: imagination has been paralyzed

McCarraher argues that neoliberalism doesn’t only reshape policy; it **deforms our capacity to imagine alternatives**. That’s why he insists the task now is not just critique but construction.

He frames this as a need for “**revitalized moral and political imagination**.” 
Then he invokes Fredric Jameson’s famous line:

* “**easier… to imagine the end of the world than… the end of capitalism**” 

He says the despair produced by this imaginative captivity often disguises itself as performative opposition:

* “**calls for subversion, transgression, or resistance**” 
* but these “**amount [to]**” nothing like “**a clear and convincing project**” of transformation 

His blunt pivot is:

* “**At some point you have to be for something**” 

So the counter-vision is explicitly *constructive*: a concrete picture of the human and the world that makes meaningful resistance possible.

### 3) Desire and political agency: “we’ve forgotten who we are”

He then makes a moral-psychological claim: politics is driven by desire, and neoliberalism shrinks desire to something timid and thin.

* “**you are what you desire**” 
* our desires are “**not strong enough… not large enough… not bold and generous enough**” 

And *why* are they stunted?

* because “**we seem to have forgotten who we are**” 

This sets up the Lewis citation as a kind of **re-anthropologizing**: restoring a thick account of the person that can expand desire and re-ground politics.

### 4) The Lewis citation as the theological core (and why it matters)

McCarraher introduces the capstone quotation as a deliberate reminder of human destiny and worth:

* Lewis “**remind[s] you… in that magnificent last paragraph**” of *The Weight of Glory* 

He then channels Lewis’s vision of human beings as *eschatological* creatures—becoming either glory or horror—and therefore never reducible to market categories.

He highlights (in quick succession) the key Lewis claims:

* “**a society of possible gods and goddesses**” 
* even “**the dullest and most uninteresting person**” may be someone you’d be “**tempted to worship**” 
* thus we must act with “**awe**” and “**circumspection**” in “**all our dealings**” 
* and in every sphere: “**friendships… loves… play… politics**” 
* culminating in the blunt negation of neoliberal “ordinariness”: “**There are no ordinary people**” 
* and the famous punch: “**You have never talked to a mere mortal**” 
* plus the ethical indictment: we “**snub and exploit**” immortals 
* and the sacramental reorientation of perception: “**Your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses**” 

McCarraher’s *use* of Lewis is strategic: neoliberalism trains us to see persons as inputs, assets, liabilities, competitors, “losers,” or productivity-units. Lewis trains us to see each person as an icon of ultimate significance—someone before whom **instrumentalization becomes blasphemous**.

He even loops back to the lecture’s opening imagery (the *Network* “face of God” sermon) to reframe what “divinity” should mean:

* “**like Howard Beale, you have seen the face of God**” 

In other words: the “face of God” isn’t the market’s cosmic order; it’s the neighbor before you.

### 5) The punchline: Lewis as a radical critique of neoliberalism

McCarraher makes the normative conclusion explicit: this Lewis passage is not pious decoration—it is an **anti-neoliberal engine**.

* “**The spirit of that paragraph is the basis of the most radical critique**” of neoliberalism 
* and it should “**send all of us out marching**” against “**every injustice and indignity**” 

So the Christian counter-vision culminates in a concrete ethical-political imperative: if persons are not “mere mortals” but creatures destined for glory, then the degradations central to neoliberal life—commodification, humiliation, abandonment, disposability—are not merely regrettable; they are **injustices and indignities** demanding action.

# Quote Bank — Christian Counter-Vision (*The Weight of Glory*)

### Decline as Possibility

> “Or Americans could actually embrace the decline of their empire as a liberating moment of possibility, accepting it with gratitude and even jubilation at the prospect of a better and lovelier country. Once relieved of the burden of empire and dispelled of the illusion that the world simply can’t survive without our own vainglorious superintendence, we would surely be weaker, but we would also be wiser, freer to assess and rearrange our affairs by truer or saner and more generous standards than productivity or technological innovation.” 

> “To create that second future, we will need some kind of revitalized moral and political imagination.” 

### Imagination vs. Resistance

> “As Frederick Jameson once ruefully observed, it seems easier now to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.” 

> “None of which amount to a clear and convincing project of social and political transformation.” 

> “At some point you have to be for something, not simply and rightly against something horrible.” 

> “Perhaps the thing most needful right now is imagination, not resistance — or perhaps better, the imagination of a future in terms of which resistance makes sense.” 

### Desire and Identity

> “As in eros, so in politics, you are what you desire. Right now, I think that too many of our desires are not strong enough. They’re not large enough. They’re not bold and generous enough.” 

> “And they’re not strong and large and bold because we seem to have forgotten who we are.” 

### Framing the Lewis Passage

> “But let’s see — as Lewis would be kind enough to remind you, in that magnificent last paragraph of his essay *The Weight of Glory* — it is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses.” 

# Full Lewis Passage (as quoted in the lecture)

> “To remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to, a loser, may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship — or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare.
>
> It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another — all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics

# Full transcript

Good afternoon.
Sisters and brothers, friends, comrades, perhaps, or so I hope enemies I love you as I'm enjoyed by the gospel.
I want to thank Arthur and the McGrath Institute for organizing this lecture.
And I'd like to also thank Robert Goulding for inviting me to participate in the John Ruskin Conference Friday and Saturday.
If you get a chance to come, you should come.
And of course, I want to thank everybody here for taking time out of their day to attend.
I'm genuinely flattered.
I want to begin by showing a clip from Network, which was a 1976 film written by Patty Chieftsky and directed by Sydney Lumet.
It's a brutal and prescient satire television, augering everything from reality TV to the erasure of the line between Pondet and reporter to the transformation of political discourse into infotainment.
It's best remembered for its unhinged news broadcaster, Howard Beal, played by Peter Finch, who exhorts his audience in one of the most famous scenes of the film to go to their windows and to yell, "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore." Articulating popular fury and frustration, Beal becomes, quote, "the mad prophet of the airwaves." And his networks number one television hit.
Alas, in one of his irangs, he exposes a shady business deal that's been brokered by the Network's Management.
And so its top executive Arthur Jensen, played by Ned Bady, decides to school Mr. Beal in the ways of the world.
Summoning the prophet to the corporate boardroom, Jensen delivers a sermon in the film's most ominous and clairvoyant moment.
The phone number in the mission is at hand.
I have seen the Shattrain fall of the racians who are lost to the clarity, the light is impending.
I'll be better with this to the light.
If I must be, it's only your mad man.
It'll be digital to the league.
How are you, no?
I was mad as a hacker.
Who is it?
I'm going to take you into a conference room seems more seamless setting for what I'm saying to you.
I started as a salesman, Mr. Beal.
I sold, sold machines and automobile parts, hand brushes and electronic equipment.
They say I can sell anything.
I like to try to sell something to you.
I'll hell, I must be home.
Please sit down.
You have met all the tribal horses on nature, Mr. Beal, and I won't have it.
It's a clear, do they get merely stopped a business deal?
That is not the case.
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country and now they must put it back.
It is a bad flow titled gravity.
It is ecological balance.
You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples that are nations, that control peoples, that are no nations, they are no Arabs, they are no third worlds, there is no West, there is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and remain into open, interacting, multivariate, multinescialed a million of dollars.
Petroud dollars, electoral dollars, multid dollars, right to mark dreams, rules, bounds and seconds.
It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
That is the natural order of things today.
That is the atomic and sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today.
And you have met all of the prime forces of nature and you will atone.
Am I getting through to you, must be?
You get up on your little 21 inch screen and how about America and democracy.
There is no America, there is no democracy.
There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union, Covide and Exhawn.
Those are the nations of the world today.
What do you think the Russians talk about in their council of the state?
Karl Marx, they get out their linear programming charts.
Statistical decision theory has been a max solutions and compute the price cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do.
We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies for this to be.
The world is a college of corporations.
And exorably determined by the immutable by laws of business.
The world is a business, Mr. Mio.
It has been since mancroll of the slime and our children will live, Mr. Mio, to see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine or oppression or brutality.
One vast and ecumenical holding for whom all men will work to serve a common perfect in which all men will hold a share of stock all necessities provided all anxieties, tranquilize, all boredom amused.
And I have chosen you, Mr. Mio, to preach this event room.
Well, why me?
Because your own television dummy, 60 million people watch you every night of the week Monday through Friday.
I have seen the phase of God.
You just might be right, Mr. Mio.
Those are the gravitational principles of Jensen's corporate cosmology, but it's also an eschatological narrative.
Composed in accordance with the hermeneutics of money, in which capitalism has supplanted God as the alpha and omega of history.
Delivered at the advent of the Gilded Age, opened by Margaret Fatcher and Ronald Reagan.
Jensen's philipic is a brazen synopsis of the peculiarity theology of neoliberalism.
Of course, many intellectuals deny that neoliberalism is anything more than a cipher.
An elastic and athema for whatever its users find objectionable in contemporary life.
As the journalist Jonathan Chate once wrote with him in patient dismissal, it's quote, "the left's favorite insult," and quote.
Others contend that if neoliberalism means anything, it marks the resurrection of Les A Fair Capitalism as an economic and moral ideal, the resurgence of the classical liberal commitment to unregulated markets and limited government.
If that's so, then there's nothing Neo about neoliberalism except its novelty to Cold War boomers coddled by the welfare and regulatory state.
And it has to be said that often left intellectuals haven't been all that clear about what distinguishes neoliberalism from its ideological predecessor.
I want to argue that neoliberalism is a thing and that it's much more than a paradigm of politics and markets.
neoliberalism names an attempt to remake all of human life in the image and likeness of the market.
It's a moral and metaphysical imagination in which capitalist property relations provide the template for understanding the world.
There is no alternative as Thatcher once declared because in this view, there truly is no alternative.
There is only one holistic system of systems.
And its capitalism all the way down.
Far from allocating goods, the market is the ontological architecture of the cosmos in this view.
An omniscient and inherent being more righteous than mere quivering, corporeal mortals.
In other words, under neoliberal auspices, the capital and market becomes the latest modern surrogate for traditional divinity.
The world is a business, Mr. Bill, and everyone here.
Money is the sacramental token.
What anthropologist once called the monah or the numa, the a-lon vitale and the market is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things.
In such a world where the Abrahamic religions had once imagined men and women in the image and likeness of God, now you are what Philip Moralski has dubbed a quote "antroponorial self, a person, or perhaps a "symarchum of such, cast in the image and likeness "of the market.
"Neoliberalism defines servitude to pecuniary values "as the purest expression of freedom.
"As the vervel amended 20 years ago, "you're a slave to money and then you die." Now first a little history lesson.
As historians such as Quince LaBaudi and Hiftotta, the genealogy of neoliberalism can be traced back to the 1920s.
During the first World War, cooperation between government and industry conferred a degree of legitimacy on state regulation, supervision, and even planning.
All in theathema to the champions of the Les A Fair, which it held swayed during the 19th century.
The post-war extension of the suffrage conferred new power on the European working classes.
Jeopardizing both the distribution of wealth and popular acquiescence in the vicissitudes of the market.
The rabble might vote themselves welfare states or even socialism and recall that as of November 1917, the Soviet Union did loom as an alternative.
And the Treaty of Versailles, by affirming the self-determination of peoples, both augured the collapse of the pre-war imperial order and validated the democratic nation state as the central political actor in World Affairs.
Thus, a system of sovereign democracies posed an impediment to the resumption of capital accumulation along the lines in place before 1914.
Neoliberalism, Slabodian, can tense, arose not so much to rehabilitate free markets as to, in his words, inoculate capitalism against the threat of democracy.
Neoliberalism began as an attempt to reimagine governance in capitalist nations in an age of mass democratic politics.
In the view of Neolibros, such as Ludwig von Miesus, Friedrich Hayek, Lionel Robbins, and Wilhelm Repka, the state must enforce property and contract law and accommodate a bare minimum of working class demands while expediting the movement of capital and commodities.
The state must not only refrain from regulating business.
It must assist from providing social welfare since the workers of the world must be united, united, not in revolutionary solidarity, but in submission to the fluctuations of the world economy.
Though ostensibly democratic, the Neoliberal state must not be an instrument of popular will.
It's more like a police station charged with managing and it need any of the pest-alential rabble, unions especially, but any form of popular mobilization to tame or eradicate capitalism.
Miesus went so far as to define the market itself as a form of democracy.
Capitalism he argued is a plebiscite of money, quote, "in which every penny represents a ballot paper." Capitalism in other words is the democracy of money.
The first three quarters of the 20th century did not offer propitious conditions for the realization of neoliberal goals.
But in the 1940s, an aspiring block of North Atlantic business leaders, intellectuals, and politicians who had never reconciled themselves to the new deal and social democracy.
Many of them concentrated in what became known as the Montpelerin Society.
All of them kept meant and eventually successful crusade to recover the holy land of unfettered accumulation.
For three decades, the relative prosperity and tranquility of what's been dubbed by historians, the golden age of capitalism hindered their efforts to destroy the consensus.
But the global economic crisis of the early 1970s created auspicious conditions for an assault on the new deal and European social democracy and the restoration of the Ossian regime, or at least would appear to be the Ossian regime.
Stagnation and falling profits provoked capital throughout the North Atlantic to unilaterally break the tenuous social truths between itself, the state and organized labor.
Where the state's main focus had been on maintaining a high level of demand.
Capital now began to insist on more attention to supply.
Hence the supply side economics of Arthur Laffer, which entailed a dramatic lowering of personal and corporate taxes, draconian cuts and social spending, deregulation of business activity, and the weakening of not crushing of unions.
The argument, as we all know, was that the enterprise and innovation unleashed by these policies would increase aggregate wealth that would then trickle down from capital to increasingly unorganized workers.
The upshot, stagnation of real wages for the last three decades, accompanied by increased worker productivity, I might add.
Himalayan levels of personal debt to make up for wage stagnation, a shift in the trajectory of capital away from production to finance, a massive upward redistribution of wealth, as well as lower average annual growth rates.
Soon spearheaded by Fathcher and Reagan in the 1980s and supplied with legitimacy by the new prominence and vigor of neoliberal academics and journalists, Hayek, the Chicago School of Economists, such as Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, evangelists of globalization, such as the New York Times Thomas Friedman, the ensuing 40-year assault on organized labor in the welfare state, issued in a resounding victory for corporate business, brought to a head in the late 1990s by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
Even those parties traditionally considered the vehicles of working class interests.
The Democrats here, the Labor Party in Britain, dubbed New Labor by Blair, the various socialist or social democratic parties elsewhere in Europe, all of them recast themselves in terms of neoliberalism.
Redefining their objectives, not as regulating or abolishing capitalism, but as making the transition to a fully-marketized world less painful and disruptive that, otherwise, might be.
When Fathcher was once asked what her greatest achievement of had been, she said without skipping a beat, new labor.
As David Harvey has written, neoliberalism has been, quote, a political project, to reestablish the conditions for capital accumulation and to restore the power of economic elites.
Harvey's definition makes it easy to equate neoliberalism with deregulation of business, but I think we need to be careful here for it's just as easy to think that deregulation is synonymous with an attack on big government.
It's important to keep in mind that neoliberals have sought not so much to limit state power as to redirect it toward the promotion and extension of market activity.
Hence the privatization of many state services, the reconstruction of those remaining public to resemble the institutions of corporate enterprise running government like a business.
The dissolution of boundaries between the state, business, non-profit groups, and NGOs, summarized in the term public-private partnership.
The diminution of the state's welfare provisions, and the dramatic augmentation of its faculties for coercion, punishment, and surveillance.
And the installation of the market from the nettle some scrutiny and interference of democratic politics.
Indeed, the redefinition of an enclosure of democracy within parameters set by the market, not by citizens, has been an achievement proudly touted by neoliberal politicians.
Witness German chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking in September 2011 to a session of the Bundestag.
We certainly live in a democracy and are glad about this.
We will find ways to shape parliamentary co-decision in such a way that it is never the less market conforming so that the respective signals emerge in the market.
Note well, democracy must be market conforming.
That's about as balled a statement of democratic subordination to economic forces as you're likely to get.
Once you realize that neoliberal's reorient state power rather than diminishing, two phenomena become comprehensible that might appear otherwise anomalous.
First, the maintenance and even the escalation of military spending after the Cold War.
And second, the market militarization of domestic police forces.
Just on a paratthetical note, I live in Ardmore, Pennsylvania on the main line outside Philadelphia, not a place known for its mean streets.
My township's police force now proudly sports a special operations vehicle.
Decked out as though it's ready for deployment to downtown Follugia.
There's absolutely nothing contradictory in the expansion of market freedom and the enlargement of the state's capacities for violence.
A global order of markets must be enforced upon recalcitrant peoples.
As New York Times, eminent blowhard Thomas Friedman put it, in a famous or rather infamous New York Times piece, for globalization to work.
America can't be afraid to act like the almighty superpower that it is.
The hidden hand of the market will not work without a hidden fist.
McDonalds cannot flourish without McDonald's.
The designer of the F-15, and the hidden fist, that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley's technology, is called the United States Army Air Force Navy and Marine Corps.
There's a weaponized the offety for you.
It's no surprise that the United States, the mighty is the most prosperous neoliberal society on Earth, should also have the largest Leviathan on the planet.
An enormous and growing prison system, a Gagaganshu and military industrial complex, a Titanic apparatus of domestic and foreign surveillance.
The greater the wealth, the greater the fear, and the greater the need to police and punish.
Now so far, so historical and political economic, but let's go back to David Harvey.
In addition to calling neoliberalism a political project, he also describes it as quote, "a utopian project "to realize a theoretical design "for the reorganization of international capitalism." We don't, I think, appreciate just how utopian a project it is and I don't think Harvey does either.
The reverence for the market among neoliberals is something more than a renaissance of Les A Fair or a desire for the liberation of capital from burdensome restraints.
In the neoliberal cosmology outlined in the work of Mesa Sennheik and dramatized in the fiction and philosophy of Iron Rand, the market suffuses the cosmos.
Money is the benchmark of rectitude.
Financial, professional, or technological prowess is the empirical proxy for be attitude.
And the aggressive unapologetic entrepreneur is the icon of existential superlativity.
neoliberalism is a more as a covert, moral, and metaphysical imagination.
Even I'll argue a surrogate theology, in which capitalist property relations provide an all-encompassing template for understanding the world.
As the political scientist Wendy Brown observes and her aptly titled "Undoing the Demos," quote, "With neoliberalism, "the market becomes the true form of all activity." Once the forum for the production and exchange of commodities, a predatory but unavoidable or deal of our bondage to the realm of necessity, the capital and market assumes a platonic character under the ages of neoliberal ideologues becoming an ontology, a hermeneutic, and an ethics for a guardian class of philosopher capitalists.
Now, we never let a serious crisis go to waste, a wonderful book that I'd urge you to read.
Moralski comes closest to capturing the super mundane ambitions of neoliberal ideology.
In Moralski's account, neoliberals eradicate any lingering distinctions among the state, society, and the market, and reconfigure both personality and the cosmos in accordance with the logic of mercenary reason.
neoliberal humanism envisions, quote, an entrepreneurial self, Moralski explains, "A portfolio of salable talents and qualities, quote, a product to be sold, a walking advertisement, a jumble of assets to be invested, an offsetting inventory of liabilities, to be pruned, outsourced, shorted, hedged against and minimized." According to what Moralski calls this "catacism of permanent metamorphosis," the neoliberal human must renounce selfish arrogance, I.e. resistance to the immutable bylaws of business, and quote, "humbly prostrate "before the wisdom of the universe, "aw wisdom registered in the turbulence of the market." In the neoliberal imagination, capitalism's laws of motion partake of a supernil, mysterious, and mandum, and freedom is servitude to the regime of vinality, mandated and sanctified by the logos." Now while purely metaphorical intent, Moralski's reference to a catacysm points to the religious qualities of neoliberalism.
Now of course, God has had several claimants to his throne, since he allegedly expired in the 19th century.
Among the substitutes for the universal truth and goodness that he provided before the Enlightenment, science, the nation, socialism, fascism, and his Terry Eagleton has argued culture.
Although many of our time, as, although many think of our time as a secular age, of irony, disenchantment, and suspicion of meta-narrow, and despite its profane, technocratic veneer of econometrics and policy walkery, neoliberalism is a story about the nature of reality, as well as a beatific vision of a heavenly city of corporate capital.
As Eagleton might put it, neoliberals replace culture with the market as modernity surrogate for traditional divinity.
The market is the great chain of being.
It's the marrow of neoliberal divinity.
Far from merely allocating goods and resources, the market is the ontological structure of the universe and inherent quintessence, wiser than any purely and fallible human being.
Now seeing the market as somehow divine or ontological isn't new, certainly not an American history.
From Puritans to Mormons to contemporary evangelicals, many Protestants, and especially after World War II, many Catholics, have long believed that success in the capitalist marketplace is a gilded sign of providential blessing.
If most Americans have relied and continue to rely on Christian theology for their pecuniary moralism, and assortment of neoliberal economists, philosophers, journalists, and other writers began to generate an ostensibly secular form of market cosmology in the mid-20th century.
Sometimes fully cognizant of what they were doing.
Neoliberals elevated the market to a position of absolute ontological sovereignty.
Now the two great intellectual godfathers of neoliberalism were msus and economists who taught at NYU's Stern School of Business and Hayek, a professor at the University of Chicago and author of the road to surfdom, one of the great canonical texts of neoliberalism.
Both men fused hostility toward the economic strictures of traditional religion with obeisances toward the market.
In his book on socialism entitled socialism, "Mesus argued that since Jesus and disciples had displayed "rezentment toward the rich, then quote "a living Christianity cannot exist side by side "with capitalism." Later, Hayek contended in the third volume of law, legislation, and liberty, a kind of somophilogica of neoliberalism.
"The morals preached by prophets and philosophers "had inhibited the expansion of capitalism.
"Capitalism arose Hayek continued only through quote, "the disregard of these indignant moralists and quote.
"Yet Hayek and Mesus account of political economy featured "an ontological status for money "and the market every bit as fundamental "as that of the god of medieval scholasticism." First Hayek, scoffing at what they consider the hubris of social democrats and socialists "who presume to plan entire economies.
"Neoliberalism, neoliberals and others have praised Hayek "for emphasizing the limits of human understanding.
"In this view, humility is the great virtue "of capitalist markets.
"Permitting the effleress in sabonchrobinorial ingenuity "and the attainment of a quote, spontaneous order "without proud and inept government planners.
"Yet Hayek himself believes both that this spontaneous order "of the market arose from human artifice "and that this artifice must be concealed "within a stupifying haze of metaphysical and chatmen." Hayek's well-known hostility to econometrics and other forms of economic modeling was on one level fundamentally political, not epistemological.
By making the market visible, econometrics made markets vulnerable to democratic scrutiny and intervention.
Empirical representation of the economy he warned in 1966.
Played into the hands of socialists and other enemies of unregulated capitalism who wanted to turn the market into quote, "a deliberately run organization serving "and agreed system of common ends." Hayek's desire to make the market ineffable, even sublime, impaled him to create in his work one of the great masterpieces of ideological sophistry. There's the recourse to recondite terminology to exclude and begile the incognacente.
Hayek banned these the word "catalaxi" for instance to describe the order created by individuals and groups participating in the global market.
Influenced by the new science of cybernetics, Hayek imagined catalaxi is a giant information processor, transmitting its delfic motions through the revelatory signals of prices and laws. In itself, catalaxi is in Hayek's own words, sublime, even transcendent, beyond the comprehension of the human mind.
Hayek also distinguished between cosmos, the realm of impersonal spontaneous order, and taxes, the realm of conscious deliberate construction.
To Hayek, the indeterminacy of cosmos constitute a quote "higher, super individual wisdom." Greater than that of any single human being or collective.
Indeed, it is because, quote, "we normally do not know who knows best," and quote, "that most decisions should be left to quote a process we do not control." The metaphysical and vaguely theological character of cosmos could not be clearer and Hayek did not hesitate to prescribe its import for economics.
He denounced the conviction, essential he claimed to any form of economic planning, that quote, "reason is capable of directly manipulating all the details of a complex society." Even the most perspicacious experts could not foresee all contingencies, discern all connections or identify all possibilities.
Appalled at the insulence of bureaucrats, Hayek marbled at the Felicidist Ignorance of Market Competitors, quote, "how little the individual participants need to know in order to be able to take the right action," and quote. What he called in the road to surf them, quote, "the impersonal and seemingly irrational forces of the market," unquote, "a rather in his view, a cosmic dispassionate but progressive providence." quote, "it was men's submission to the impersonal forces of the market that in the past have made possible the growth of civilization," unquote.
As the most dynamic of the products of spontaneous growth, the incalculable market of capitalism is the highest form of cosmos. Now Hayek's elevation of the unregulated markets core in determinacy into a central ontological principle is key to understanding not only his perverse praise of ignorance as a virtue, but also his ill concealed antipathy to democracy.
He condemned all attempts by government to disseminate knowledge about market conditions as "an incomplete and therefore erroneous rationalism," unquote. Hayek objected to democratic restriction of the market, not only because he dismissed the intellectual qualifications of ordinary citizens, but because it amounted in his view to a futile act of influence against the sacrosanct order of things. In Jensen's words meddling with the primal forces of nature." quote, "There is not much reason to believe he asserted in the Constitution of liberty that if at any one time the best knowledge which some possesses were made available to all, the result would be a much better society," unquote. Now although these statements have been lauded for their insight into human limitations and their preclusion of economic planning, Hayek intended them explicitly to preempt any democratic restraint on the power of capital and its managerial or technocratic expertise. Quote, "The best knowledge which some possess," unquote, became a positive danger when exercise to regulate the economy in the interests of a democratic polity. Quote, "It is at least possible in principle he mused in 1967 that a democratic government may be authoritarian. A authoritarian here defined as any unnatural attempt to obstruct or modify the impromptu order of the market. The aristocratic control of the market represented an attempt to substitute taxes for cosmos, a scandalous fee of ontological sacrilege. Yet cosmos itself turned out to be an invention, as Hayek made clear that capital in the state lay behind the sober magic of market contingency. As he rather brazenly admitted, quote, "an order which would have to be described to spontaneous rests on rules which are entirely the result of deliberate design," unquote. Cosmos was nothing more than taxes, occluded by philosophical pilaver about spontaneity. Humble deference to the market was not in fact a recognition of the wisdom of the universe. Rather, it was quote, "a method of social control Hayek writes in the road to surfdom," that quote, "should be deemed superior because of our ignorance of its precise results." Who had deemed the market superior? Well, everyone according to Hayek, because, quote, "Once we have agreed to play the game and profited from its results, it is a moral obligation on us to abide by the results even if they turn against us." This is the stupid kind of argument made by the likes of Ben Shapiro.
If you go into a market and you buy something, you must be a capitalist.
Nitwit. Now, I certainly don't recall having agreed to play the game.
But notice something else here. Hayek, like his neoliberal disciples and descendants, has erased the distinction between liberty and compulsion in the mechanisms of the market.
If we freely quote, "submit to the adjustments which the market forces upon us," unquote.
Hayek has implicitly admitted that the market is a lattice work of coercions, from which the powerless are unable to dissent. You're told in the first week or so of economics class that there are free economies such as capitalism and command economies, such as those in the former Soviet Union. You were misinformed. Capitalism is a command economy of freedom.
Now, what of the market's losers reject the edicts of the market and its unaccountable will?
Hayek proposed that the authoritarian nature of the free market could be shrouded most effectively in the instance of religion and tradition. And that if those didn't work, there's always the employment of state violence. Hayek aligned religion and tradition with the imperatives of market cosmology, quote, "submission to undesigned rules and conventions whose significance and importance we largely do not understand." This reverence for tradition is indispensable for the working of a free society, unquote. Hayek openly acknowledged that the rules of competitive enterprise endure because, quote, "the groups who observe them were more successful and displaced others." And because these winners draped their triumph in the robes of tradition and custom. There is no alternative because there has never been any alternative.
It has been since man crawled out of the slime. If tradition failed to elicit and unquestioning subservience to the wisdom of the market, God properly sure of his disapproval for aquisiteness could be resurrected and instrumentalized from the depths of the historical mausoleum.
Quote, "The only religions that have survived Hayek reflected shortly before his death are those which support property and the family." And a tradition or God weren't enough, fascism was accrued but reliable expedient. In the 1920s, Mises had applauded Benito Mussolini's imposition of a business-friendly dictatorship and liquidating the socialist opposition.
Later, Hayek Friedman and other Chicago school economists toward Myers of General Augusto Pinnishay, dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990, who enlisted them to turn the country into a laboratory for neoliberal experimentation. What I want to underscore about Hayek is that he presided over what the theologian William Cathema has called a migration of the Holy, a forced march of sanctity and reverence from the sacred to the ostensibly secular.
In herding the duty of divine vindication from a waning Protestant hegemony, Hayek illustrates how capitalist economics has always been a kind of theodity.
What seems irrational to mere mortals is actually the emanation of a superior, unaccountable wisdom, a modern analog to the pre-modern theological concept of providence.
In Hayek's pecuniary ontology, ignorance is bliss and submission is freedom.
The more we genuflect to the logos of the market, in faithful subservience to its mandates, our hustling humility is rewarded with riches in the sublunary realm of business.
And those mandates are promulgated in the numerical vernacular of money, the mercenary emblem of the cosmos. Neoliberalism isn't just the highest stage of capitalism.
It's the highest stage of capitalist enchantment. When money comes into its own as the animumundi, the spirit of a marketized planet.
Now for his part, Mises explicitly identified reason with pecuniary calculation.
In the absence of a competitive market whose processes are ordered by money, quote, "There would be no means of determining what was rational." Without money, Mises contended, it is quote impossible to speak of rational production.
Rational defined in pecuniary terms.
Note how the entire argument turns on a subtle conflation of reason with monetary valuation.
If money determines both the value and the rationality of human creativity, then both morality and reason are defined in its terms.
Mises insisted further that all obstacles to efficiency and expansion had to be obliterated.
As he declared in 1958, no religious or ethical tenant.
Might can justify a policy that aims at the substitution of a social system under which output per unit of input is lower for a system in which it is higher. No religious or moral tenant.
Even Adam Smith didn't make the grade in Mises' mercenary estimation.
Mises lamented in 1957 that Smith did not quote "free himself" from the standards and terminology of traditional ethics, which had set limits on material accumulation.
To Mises' the market was even a venue of aesthetic evaluation as well.
"There is no yardstick, no yardstick, to measure the aesthetic worth of a poem or of a building.
No yardstick that is other than money. The most efficient measure of loveliness." "What counts in the frame of the market economy," Mises pronounced.
"The valuations actually manifested by people in buying or not buying.
Outside of money, there is no reality." "We're beauty." "We're springs us to Iron Rand." "Mentor to former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, favorite novelist of former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, one of the worst writers of the 20th century, and one of the more unappealing and appalling human beings who've ever taken up space on the planet." Now, if you think me unduly harsh, then prick up your ears.
"A new faith is needed as she invited her journals." "A definite positive set of new values and new interpretation of life." That faith objectiveism was as she put it quote, "a spiritual ethical, philosophical groundwork for the belief in the system of free enterprise." One of the many heralds of the death of God, Rand was indeed a pioneer in her nomination of the dollar as a worthy and durable surrogate.
At the taudry conclusion of Atlas shrugged, John Gaul traces the sign of the dollar, not the sign of the cross in the empty heavens.
Atlas shrugged, by the way, is a book that Ryan says he re reads every year, "Good Lord." And made all of his interns peruzes. I read through all of Iron Rand's work, all of it.
"I did the dirty work so you wouldn't have to." "So you're welcome." Objectivism is thoroughly mercantil.
Commodity exchange is the paradigm of human life.
As the copper tycoon, Francesco Danconia, where does she come up with these names?
"Ses in Atlas shrugged, quote, "Money is the barometer of virtue." Like Hayek and the principle of cosmos, Rand turned the trucking and bartering of the market into a universal catacusim. Trade, she believed, is quote, "the only ethic, rational, ethical principle for all human relationships." Personal and social, private and public, spiritual and material.
The Randian individual, quote, does not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or flaws, only for his virtues.
A very meticulous accountant of morality, the Randian individual, quote, "urns when he gets and does not give or take the undeserved." Now, unlike saints or other mootures, one of Rand's signature approaches.
Randian individuals seek the only real meaning of life in exchange value and rates of profit.
"We exist for the sake of earning rewards as gallblets." As Rand's disposition on love demonstrates for her even the most intimate affairs find their finest consummations in a monetary nexus. Love and friendship, she argue, constitute, spiritual payment. Tendered for quote, "the personal selfish pleasure," which one man derives from the virtues of another's character. "What is love?" I just told you. It's payment." Rand's aversion to Christianity further exemplifies this callous and cruel way of looking at the world.
She denigrated Christianity for its exaltation of charity.
Quote, "Christianity is the best kindergarten for communism possible." In her words, which might rather be taken as a compliment by some of us.
In her journals, she railed against charity as a dangerous and even sinister practice.
As Christians and other promiscuous lovers of humanity, threatened to erase those distinctions of merit necessary for any social order. Charity Rand asserted should be bestowed like gold from a tight-wads purse. It should mark an augment both the power of the giver and the impotence of the recipient.
Quote, "Charity to an inferior does not include the charity of not considering him and inferior," she explained. The lowly objective charity should quote, "remember and acknowledge his position." To give anyone something for nothing, something which kind of sounds like grace in classical theology.
Giving something for nothing was an act of malice inflicted on the Maritorious, according to Rand. Quote, "The ultimate viciousness of charity," she reflected, "lay in its cavalier indifference to achievement as a criterion of human worth." Ignoring his actual worth as a man, a worth determined solely in the competitive marketplace.
One hands to the weak quote, "the moral and spiritual benefits," such as love, respect, consideration, which better men have to earn. Now critics at the time, at the time, dismiss her fiction and philosophy as pitiful. Sophamoric, one reviewer wrote in the National Review No. S, "Patent Medicine," he scoffed. That was quote, "probably without lasting ill effects." That reviewer was Whitaker Chambers.
No one in the 1950s imagined how quickly and widely Rand's appeal would metastasize.
Indeed, former speaker Ryan saw the enchantment of much of his own undergraduate kegur fantasy of demolishing the new deal and remaking the country into a continental diorama of Gaul's libertarian elisian. Today, the most radical disciples of neoliberal divinity reside in Silicon Valley, where a paradise of innovators and disruptors—God, lose those terms, please— epitomized by PayPal co-founder Peter Teele of Vampire, a literal vampire.
Be out of five themselves as the avant-garde of the species. Some even aspire to retain eternal life in the imperian of the technological singularity, uploading their consciousness to the cloud before their "corporial bodies expire." It's a crazy, hard, and merciless conception of human life, run from which all, or maybe most of us, would recoil when it stated so openly and unequivocally. Yet, it's also arguably the hegemonic way in which neoliberal societies now define personality and social life. In fact, until very recently, neoliberalism enjoyed what they call in military parlance of full spectrum dominance over the American moral imagination.
For the last 30 years, business has exercised a near-monopoly on our symbolic universe, and the iconography of capital has achieved an unprecedented level of omnipresence.
In advertising, marketing, and public relations, in market speak, and financial journalism, in the stream of stock prices that seem to frame every image on cable news networks.
Business has inscribed its commands and desires in the firmament of popular culture.
The market has become our ontological sublime. The entrepreneur and the technological innovator rise into the communion of saints in the pantheon with demigods. Economists have assumed holy orders as the number crunching clarity of a pecuniary civilization. And the technical and financial plutocracy has publicized its health as the hip-est ruling class in history.
And to enter or more likely to service that class, you, unless you're a moocher, must turn your life into a commodity to be marketed and sold. You are a utility maximizer with a gradient of preferences.
You are a human resource, human capital, and entrepreneur of the self-abrand brand you, a package of vendable talents and qualities, a walking breathing resume, a bundle of assets to be invested or hedged, liabilities to be cut, a skill to be cultivated or abandoned in accordance with the viscestitudes of the marketplace. To display your individuality, you must be a rebel, a rulebreaker, a disruptor of conformity. You can't be average. You must be heedless of those whose lives you disrupt. They are, after all, the losers. The mediocre collateral damage of your quest for productivity and innovation. Now this redefinition of the self is made possible as Moralski has observed, not only by economic and political changes but by contemporary communications technology. We should start to see Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other venues, not simply a social media but as technologies of the self to use Michelle Foucos forase, material implements for the creation of neoliberal personalities.

Facebook, for instance, is an exemplary neoliberal technology. It's an extremely successful business that instructs its users in the fabrication of entrepreneurial identities. It requires the user to create a profile from a limited repertoire of stereotypes which in turn are supposed to attract friends and hits to your pages. It employs algorithms that force users to periodically change their profiles and thus destabilize their identities. An education in other words in market personhood. The cultural damage to which I want to call special attention is the neoliberal academies in the published conception of intellectual life. Intellect is increasingly seen as a thoroughly instrumental faculty and ensemble of skill sets to be assembled and utilized for monetary and technological ends. The world that this intellect seeks to apprehend is considered utterly transparent and ultimately manageable. All problems can be defined and resolved with the correct application of credentialed expertise. Mystery is either an insufficiency of data or it's just the twaddle of humanist romanticism. Modeled implicitly after data processing, the life of the mind becomes the province of problem solvers innovators and God I hate this stupid word, thought leaders.

Creativity almost always means problem-solving. Usually for the purpose of designing or marketing ever cooler gadgets and services. With the mechanization of production as its implicit model, the cognitive project of neoliberal technocracy is the automation of the human intellect--The rewiring of the mind to work with the speedy and unreflective precision of algorithms.

The formulaic and self-important vacuosness of the technocratic wing of the professional managerial elite is distilled in fact in that stupid term thought leader. It's at once selfish and self-congratulatory. It denotes the neoliberal reduction of intellect to hollow competitive computation. The plutocratic incorporation and branding of intelligence as a research and development enterprise. In the neoliberal academy, intellect is pecuniary and engineering rationality.
The genius of the entrepreneurial self. Like the student debt that's preparing many of you to say two words, yes boss. The ideal of the entrepreneurial self serves a fundamentally disciplinary function.
Reinforcing the precarious nature of work in today's digitalized low wage, careously employed, and increasingly automated capitalism. One in which you are casually expendable and which places a premium on everlasting metamorphosis. Upgrade your skills, your profile, your resume.
But don't worry, complain or God help you call a union. Losing your job or seeing your skill set rendered obsolescence is an opportunity for growth, creativity, empowerment. Watch every single one of those words when they're used, head for the hills. When your own exploitation can be recast as a project rather than a problem or an injustice, a source of fulfillment rather than an indignity, then solidarity with others can be vilified as conformism. The herd instinct of losers, the last refuge of mediocrities. And what happens to those losers and to those mediocrities, especially to the new class of unfortunates who populate the food pantries and homeless shelters, inoculated against empathy by the regnant business culture. We're enjoying to adopt the hotty and insuciant and dismissive perspective of the boss, to revel in his or her ostentatious contempt for the incompetent and the unsuccessful. As Maraski has observed incisively neoliberal culture exhibits a punitive sateomorphism toward the poor and the weak. The apprentice, shark tank, undercovered boss comprise a veritable theater of cruelty. Witnesses well, the increasingly militaristic and gladiatorial ambience of our fitness programs, where the casual barbarism of reality television, in which everything, from cooking to running a restaurant, becomes an interness in contest of wills, in which cruelty and humiliation await the weak, such as the psychopathology of the neoliberal moral imagination.
Now perhaps we're waking up to how awful this neoliberal hegemony has really become.
Given the political atmosphere of the last decade, the acquiescence may be dissipating, to reveal betrayal, anger and resentment, all of which may intensify as Americans realize that their way of life is neither exceptional nor blessed nor imperishable.
The American Empire is neither happy nor noble and it's decline will be one of the pivotal episodes of the 21st century. What will Americans do when they begin to doubt their divine and nohinkment and a scatological mission? What will they do when they conclude that they never enjoyed the mandate of heaven? They might redouble their efforts in denial, unwilling to relinquish or even temper their faith in the enchanting varieties of the market.
If they hanker to the delusions of nativeist populism, they'll exacerbate racial animosity while also entrenching the power of our mercenary overlords. If they affirm a renovated neoliberalism, they may attempt to prolong their economic and geopolitical imperium.
Yet their victory will be brief and it will be peric.
For they will have purchased their temporary reprieve in the currency of fear and recrimination and death. Or Americans could actually embrace the decline of their empire as a liberating moment of possibility, accepting it with gratitude and even jubilation at the prospect of a better and lovely country. Once relieved of the burden of empire and dispeled of the illusion that the world simply can't survive without our own vanguardious superintendents, we would surely be weaker, but we would also be wiser, freeer to assess and rearrange our affairs by true or saneer and more generous standards than productivity or technological innovation.
To create that second future, we will need some kind of revitalized moral and political imagination.
As Frederick Jameson once roofily observed, it seems easier now to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. The ubiquitous but unavowed despair many, who long for something different, is camouflaged rhetorically by calls for subversion, transgression, or resistance.
None of which amount to a clear and convincing project of social and political transformation.
At some point you have to be for something, not simply and rightly against something horrible.
But it's the very capacity to imagine alternatives that neoliberalism seems to have effectively paralyzed. What was and is still called the left was marked in part by faith in the ability of human beings to collectively construct a world in which all of us could live and flourish.
But it's precisely that ability that neoliberalism's capitulation to the market has its seams so successfully called into question. So perhaps the thing most needful right now is imagination, not resistance, or perhaps better, the imagination of a future in terms of which resistance makes sense.
As an arrosse so in politics, you are what you desire. Right now, I think that too many of our desires are not strong enough. They're not large enough. They're not bold and generous enough.
And they're not strong and large and bold because we seem to have forgotten who we are.
But let's see as Lewis be kind enough to remind you, in that magnificent last paragraph of his essay, The Weight of Glory. It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses.
To remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talked to, a loser may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, would be strongly tempted to worship or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare.
It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities. It is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. It is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit. Your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. In other words, like Howard Beale, you have seen the face of God.
The spirit of that paragraph is the basis of the most radical critique you can make of neoliberalism and it should send all of us out marching against every injustice and indignity in the world.
It demolishes every idol of progress, every chivaliff of productivity, and every banality about value and innovation. And it is the spirit from which any alternative to neoliberalism must in the end draw its imagination. Thank you.
And we actually have about ten minutes for a Q&A session.
Do we have any questions?
Well, thank you very much, Robert. See a great thought leader on this topic.
I was curious to know, I was curious to know, I'd love to your mention of Pinochet in the neoliberal glorification of Chile. I'm sure as your wealth familiar, the country is in protests and great upheaval right now, many say because of those very neoliberal systems.
And I wonder if you could put your theology or your critique of the neoliberal theology into practice in Chile as they approach a reform on their constitution or referendum, someone say a great moment in their country, a great judgment on the neolibrosum there.
What would you recommend to them? Would you say it's possible to live inside a reformed neoliberal state? Would you recommend they do something entirely new, something radical?
What is your advice to the Chilean people as they figure out what to do with neoliberalism in their country?
Well, I want to preface this, you know, by saying that I know next to nothing about the Chilean situation. So, you know, I might try to evade your question by saying it's not for me to tell the people of Chile what they should do with their with their social and economic affairs.
Look, I think that I've been reading a lot of anarchism lately.
One of my favorite writers has become David Graver, who's work I would recommend you especially debt the first five thousand years.
And one of the things that Graver has been recommending is to try to think about ways of organizing social and economic affairs which circumvent the state. You know, I'm thinking of things possibly like the Mondragon cooperatives in Spain, which of course have had their problems, but there there is an attempt at least to organize workers in such a way that they have genuine control over their lives, genuine control over their own work, even genuine control over their own technological design.
One of the things that bothers me a great deal about the contemporary left in this country is that especially those associated with Jacobin is that they seem to have sort of outsourced their political imaginations to the Elon Musk. They seem to think that I'm just going to vent here.
These guys are designing technologies in a capitalist context.
And all of a sudden you are going to take them over and you're going to make it democratic socialist.
Anybody who's read Marx knows this won't happen.
This bothers me a great deal. I think that one of the things that Chilean workers and American workers should demand is control over technological design, not just over their work.
So if I had a piece of advice to give the Chilean workers or, you know, Chilean unions or Chilean cooperatives, it would be tried to create forms of ownership and forms of technological design that genuinely are democratic in the workplace. Is this going to be easy? No.
But I think it is a worthy goal.
Relative to your concluding point, it seems that there's a need for a cultural political, maybe even religious product, a process or project of solidarity.
I guess it would be a term I'd use that requires imagination and not being slave to ideological language and frameworks. Do you see any signs out there, any instances of something emerging that's hopeful? Yes, I do. I see them in a number of places, a number of venues. They're not all necessarily compatible, but at least I see, I think Occupy was a missed opportunity in many ways.
One of the complaints that was often leveled at Occupy was, "Well, you guys don't have a plan.
You don't have an agenda." I said that back in 2011, too. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought, "Okay, but maybe what we need here is some more spirit." And imagination before you get to the programmatic side. I think it's possible for us, especially in our situation now, where we're thinking, "Oh my God, we've got to do something. We've got to do something." I think it's Slavoy's Jizjek who wants Koshin against this, when everybody says, "Do something, do something, do something." No, maybe what you should do is just stop and think about what you're doing. I think that you can see this in Occupy, as I said, I think you see this in many interesting anarchist kinds of discussions that are going on. Look, even the Bernie Sanders campaign, you know, I mean, is in many ways a very conventional social democratic kind of vision, and I would have certain critiques about Sanders relying too much, I think, in some ways, on a kind of old-fashioned, progressive, you know, agenda. But the very fact that these things are there, I think, is a sign of hope. Yeah, so again, I don't think all of these things are compatible, but they are a sign, not just of discontent, but there is, I think, at least some kind of creativity, or some kind of creative economic and social experimentation going on. Yeah.
I'm over here now, sorry. Speaking of technology, and imagination, so a lot of times when people go, what we need is a way to go forward, unimagination wise. You know, people would think, we're talking about literature or film or things like this, but it seems to me, unfortunately, the imaginative ones have been lawyers and tech people. So if you think of the book, you know, surveillance age of capitalism, yes. You know, Google very much, like very imaginatively, imagine biographical information and made it a new venture of conquest that they could, and then they, they've rammed through legal changes to make this the case. So when we're talking about a renewed imagination, it's not just for the English geeks that are hanging out Friday and Saturday, it's actually like an, a reimagination of law when it comes to technology and I don't know how much pushback or how much you see people trying to explore that being a imaginative about laws to sort of break the power of the, I mean, technology seems to be where we're inventing that and then they're encasing it in law, and that's one of the most severe problems that we face. I don't know if you can speak to that at all. Yeah, Shesana Zuboff's book is a really indispensable one, and one of the reasons that she would be another sign of hope to me is that when you have a Harvard Business School professor who is blowing, you know, a whistle on this kind of development, you know that you know something's wrong. You know, Harvard Business School is not exactly known as a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiments. So when she writes this, I do think that technology and the development of alternative kinds of technology to the sorts of automation that we're all enthralled by now is going to be absolutely crucial.
If I may engage in some shameless self-promotion, I actually wrote a two-part essay in Rarritan on this, this whole question about automation and alternative technological futures. And there's a tradition which has kind of gone into a band, but I hope we see a revival of it. It's the sort of John Ruskin, William Morris, in an art country, Louis Mumford way of thinking about technology to try to make it human scale, to try to make it genuinely democratic, and to not worry so much about how productive it is. Right? When you start thinking about the impact of technology on workers and how workers own personalities can be crafted and able to flourish simply through work, that's a way of thinking about technology which I think the folks in Silicon Valley just they wouldn't be able to wrap their heads around this. Right? Technology to these guys is all about productivity and coolness. It's not about human flourishing in any way. So that's the kind of technological vision or future that I'd want to see. I'm Timothy Troutner, grad student in theology.
Oh, sorry. I have a question about what you think Neuliberalism has done to the American Church, especially the Catholic Church, how it has transformed the Catholic Church in any way.
And if there are any places in the American Church where you see people thinking outside of the paradigm of Neoliberalism or has it been that the Church has been sort of co-opted by Neoliberal logic internally. I just wonder if you have any thoughts. Well, I'll start. Let me answer that question first by saying where you will not find any kind of creative or interesting thought the leadership. And that's not just at the Catholic Church. I think just about all Christian denominations their leadership has been bought and paid for. They have no interest whatsoever. I think in foaming any kind of fundamental social or economic change they simply don't. So I'm convinced that you are not going to get much creative thinking from the you know the leadership. I think you see it in places which are often I think vilified or there's sometimes dismissed as kind of softy, soft, lefty you know sort of places like we have a at Villanova we have a peace and justice program.
Now I know some eyes might be rolling okay at the back of their heads you know when I say that.
But it seems to me the only place where you're going to get people thinking about John Ruskin and William Morris or Lewis Mumford because they actually engage with these people. We have students read them and talk about them. So it seems to me once again this is going to be a time when the lady is you know going to have to come into its own again and you know maybe teach cardinals had to be Christians once again. So it's it's academic venues the Catholic worker you know as as much of a critic as I can be of the Catholic worker and I think there's a certain kind of I might as well put my cards on the table there's a kind of ruralism kind of window barriism which I'm not completely convinced by you know to be honest. I think they asked the right kind of questions though about technology and about the purposes of an economy right now the conclusions to which the Catholic workers sometimes come or to which window barriism sometimes come are not ones that I would necessarily endorse but I think that like I said the questions they ask are often the right ones because they do not insist that the standard of technology or the standard of an economy for that matter is GDP. I just want to take an opportunity to say this because if you're not going to the Rusk of Conference right there's this principle that Rusk and has about economics which should be the one that's taught it won't be but it's the one that should be. So we're told right that the economy should be judged by how much GDP growth increases every year right oh it went up 2% this year oh it went up 3% even better. Rusk and divides economics into wealth and what he calls "illf" okay wealth is that material or service which actually encourages you to flourish. Elf is like cigarettes. Elf is all kind I don't know processed mean but you know I don't know stop eating that stuff.
It's it's right. Elf is any kind of material or service that actually detracts you will not find this in any sort of conventional economic textbook. Oh you know they might talk about externalities but notice the word oh well yeah we can pollute a river but that's an externality.
Sorry we polluted you.
Thank you so much. I said a question about the state of the left kind of a European it seems like one massive distinction between the right and the left is that the right has somehow figured out a way to operate despite and through and under all the different modes or visible forms of fragmentation. Democrats try to impeach a president at the same time sign massive military funding expansion bills and stuff like that. So and if you look at the history of radical leftism you know beginning from the anarchism communism schism at the first communist international trotsky ice going one direction everyone you know that we haven't been able the radical left has not been able to maintain that sort of a depth unity that that the right has. So in terms of the future for a radical left does Christianity offer any help with basically building a way of being unified despite ideological differences and what does that look like moving forward?
I think a number of things come to mind one is okay and I'm gonna steal this from David Hart so I told him I would I'm stealing this from David Hart and a new kind of emphasis on Christian universalism as opposed to this kind of you know national conservatism or whatever nonsense you know has been promulgated on the right lately basically I think is a way for a lot of right wing intellectuals to not lose relevance I'm enough of a cynic you know to actually think that a lot of people who have signed onto this are afraid of losing their relevance so they've decided oh well maybe we should sign one with Trump you know in this sort of thing so I think that that kind of an emphasis on Christian universalism is is indispensable. Another thing that I think that Christians have to offer to the left is precisely what I gesture toward here is a new kind of metaphysical imagination right if you think that the world right ultimately is nothing more than disenchanted dumb inanimate stuff right it seems to me that it doesn't matter what your good intentions are you are going to end up exploiting that world in some way that is inimical to human flourishing you know look I and I would I would agree with a lot of you know the program of various socialist and anarchists in in this regard but it seems to me that there's a new kind of metaphysical imagination that we could try at least to offer to the left and say look if you think about the world as a place that is in fact sacramental then you are going to treat that world in a different way you're going to treat others in a different way if you believe this you are not going to be so prone to exploit it as simply you know a collection or a warehouse of resources. I actually think that there are at least some on the left who might be open to this because I think there are some on the left who are beginning to understand that the the traditional kind of left inheritance from the enlightenment is maybe a dead end but it seems to me that we have to do it you know it seems to me that you can't simply say yeah I know you guys don't you know your suspicious of religion blah blah blah well okay but the next step right has to be here's what we have to offer and not simply keep saying may it call but right all the time so I'd like to thank you for the lively discussion and all that remains used to think our distinguished speaker.
