# Successful startups don't start more. They finish more.

## How Puzzles Get Solved

We’ve discovered that there are no simple problems in utility billing. We’ve recognized this fact in our words but not in our tactical decision making.

Consider this metaphor: a 2000-piece jigsaw puzzle is emptied onto a table. The goal is to clear the table, but the rule is you must complete the puzzle first. Maybe, like me, you don’t even like jigsaw puzzles, but it’s doable. 

Then, someone dumps a different puzzle onto the table, right on top of the pieces from the first. The rules haven’t changed. You have to solve both puzzles in order to put them away. Has your time to a clean table only just doubled?

## The Bottleneck You Can't See

Eli Goldratt spent decades teaching manufacturers about constraints: every system has exactly one bottleneck that determines total throughput.[^2] Add capacity anywhere except the bottleneck and you just create inventory pileup.

In complex work, the bottleneck isn't typing speed or hours logged. It's cognitive assembly time—the duration required to build a complete mental model, hold it stable long enough to solve the problem, and encode the solution before the model decays.

Running five parallel initiatives with five team members doesn't create five parallel streams of progress. It guarantees every project receives fragmented attention and none receive the sustained focus required to push through to completion.

The collaboration dependencies make it worse. Modern work is deeply interconnected—shared knowledge bases, workflow solutions, data relations, design systems, APIs, tribal knowledge. When five teammates concentrate on one project, these conversations happen in minutes because everyone is holding the same model in active memory. Spread those same five people across five separate projects, and every conversation becomes a cold start. "Wait, which system are we talking about? What was the context again?"

Parallelism works when work is genuinely independent—no shared resources, no collaboration needed, fully specified execution. *That describes almost nothing in modern software development.*

Manufacturing figured this out decades ago and gave it a name: *batch size is the enemy of flow. Your projects are batches.* This is the key lesson in *The Phoenix Project.*[^3]

## What Slowness Actually Is

When teams run too many complex projects in parallel, every project’s velocity towards completion slows down. Gerald Weinberg quantified this in 1992.[^1] Two concurrent projects lose 40% of productive time to context switching. Three projects lose 60%.

When projects take too long, the instinct is to diagnose team problems. The estimates must be wrong. We need more senior people. They must not be working hard enough. But typically the problem is that the team is structurally prevented from building the momentum that makes complex work solvable.

When you add another major initiative to a team already running three projects, the math seems simple: three projects becomes four. But that's not how the cost actually works. You're not adding 25% more capacity demand. You're fragmenting 100% of working memory across four contexts instead of three. The time cost isn't additive—it's multiplicative. Four projects don't take 33% longer than three projects. They can take twice as long, or never finish at all.

## What Changes the Outcome

**Successful startups don't start more. They finish more.**

This means making some uncomfortable choices. New initiatives go in a queue and nothing leaves that queue until something else ships. When someone requests an urgent pivot, the question becomes: "Which active project do we pause, and what's the restart cost?" Track cycle time—idea to production—not utilization.

These changes feel inefficient. You watch talented engineers occasionally blocked on one thing when they could be spinning up something else. You say no to good ideas, or at least "not yet." You feel like you're leaving capacity on the table.

But here's what you actually get: projects that *finish*. And completed projects are the only things that create business value.
