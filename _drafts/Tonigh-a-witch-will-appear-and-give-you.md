Tonight, a witch will appear and give you a galaxy.
You will not know what to do with it.  
The shape is awkward, and the style doesn't go with your decor.  
The witch will consider the problem.  
"Have you considered the bookshelf?" she will say.  
Or it might work as a mobile in the corner there.  
Of course you've thought about the bookshelf.  
And a galaxy is not like a houseplant, content to sit in one place and grow peacefully.  
You'll have to dust off the interstellar radiation.  
Keep an eye on its expansion.  
Watch out for its tendency to drift.  
This one looks like trouble, too.  
Its black hole roils, and the spiraling arms hook out to catch whatever passes.  
You already have a cat. That's enough chaos.  
You'd wave it away, but she wrapped it nicely.  
And witches are notoriously touchy about this kind of thing.  
So you smile, hold it in your hands, lift it to the light.  
And watch it sparkle under your own strange sun.  
"You know, I'm not sure what I would do with a galaxy.  
"I feel quite enough responsibility in the care and shelter of my many books.  
"Books aren't quite galaxies, but they are certainly windows peeping out onto other realities.  
"Which is almost the same thing."
