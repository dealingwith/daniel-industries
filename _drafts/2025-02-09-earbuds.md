Put these earbuds in your holes
Close yourself off from the whole
Listen to the warm glow
Of your favorite narrative
Podcast or show
Self-affirmation, no bias detection
Just you and your favorite bros

Put these things in your ears
There's no need to hear
While you run or you wait
Or you hang or you ride
This beat will synchronize to your gait
Those others on whom you affix your gaze
Are probably bitches or hoes

Affix this idea to your mind's eye
With our words you can say goodbye
To your past mistakes
For one hundred dollars this cream and this powder
Will make your future like cake
