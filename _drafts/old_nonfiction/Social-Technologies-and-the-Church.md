Social Technologies and the Church

Two long years ago Jordon Cooper wrote a piece for Next-Wave entitled "[Blogging: Advice for Church Websites](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614192331/http://www.next-wave.org/apr02/blogging.htm)." At the time blogs, although ancient in the ever-evolving space of the digerati, were relatively new to church culture. While Jordon's article was aimed at churches, if church websites in 2004 are any indication, they did not take his advice, and to their detriment. A broader culture, however, particularly that collectively labeled as the "emergent church," has seen a rapid adoption of personal publishing technologies over the course of the last two years.

Now the blogging landscape has changed--blogs, and the technologies attached to them, are simply a part of a larger category known as "social software." Blogs were and will always be a niche product, no matter how many circles the blog square gets shoved into. The important aspect of blogging was never the technology itself but the paradigms it released into the mainstream--those same ideas Jordon explored--of conversation, of community, of digitally enabling and growing the social networks that existed already. Like church.

Measured by the amount of money and media thrown at Friendster, Orkut, and their ilk, there must be something to this next generation of social software tools. The curious thing with these products is that they take a ruggedly individualistic approach to community building. The initiators in this space have made a mistake common among technologists--that of seeing the software as a panacea instead of as a tool. 

Social technologies could benefit the church, and vice versa, in both quantifiable and immeasurable ways, but the church--like any other established social structure--must take a few things into account in order to see these results:

    1. Nuance. Current social technologies have no built-in way to meaningfully differentiate between my church and my soccer team, because they were built with me, not the communities I'm a part of now or the groups that might form through the use of the technology, at the center. More importantly, there is no way for me to differentiate myself to my church as opposed to my soccer team. We behave and present ourselves in subtly important ways as we move throughout our social circles, and these nuances need to be represented in our social software.

    2. Commitment. Most organizations like to assign "edge" projects to one individual and hope for the best. Unfortunately the best a church is going get out of social software simply installed and forgotten about is nothing. Software is a tool not a magic pill, and deploying and using a tool so that it works for a group of people requires time and resources. Don't think in terms of, "We're going to use this software and XYZ is going to happen." Think, "We want to achieve XYZ and this software is going to help us do that."

    3. Purpose. Friendster has received millions of dollars from venture capitalists for being a tool used primarily for the arrangement of sexual rendezvous. What church wants to be associated with that meme? Because most social software is general and individualistic, it is not seen as a valid community-building solution for those in the community-building business. Turn the tables and set out to create meaningful, digitally relevant spaces that enhance and grow your church.

    4. Intelligence. Most businesses have a Chief Technology Officer, so why not churches? As far as I know, all organizations have the same issues in managing their material and intangible infrastructures, and technology is an integral part of addressing those issues (and often also an issue itself). Churches are rich, diverse pools of raw data, social networking, and distributed resources. Technology exists to enable and facilitate all of these from an organizational perspective.

Imagine your church community where:

    • the library was the collective library of all its members

    • the data from the community's bloggers, writers, thinkers, speakers--all the experts in their field--was available and usable (just skip digitizing your bulletin board and make that information meaningful)

    • the bible study you participate in was not an isolated event but an integrated experience the drew from all the other small groups past and present

    • information about the community's movement throughout the city was instantly available and broadcast to subscribers in their chosen medium (your standard mailing list on a triple espresso)

    • small groups, mission trips, seminars, and communion dinners would form not through the strained efforts of a single leader or spokesperson, but automatically, organically, and collectively through the people that would naturally be the most committed and contributive. 

...then you might imagine a church that exists not only as a subculture or a school, but once again as the pinnacle of our social existences--the chosen place to be, the preferred space within which to live.
