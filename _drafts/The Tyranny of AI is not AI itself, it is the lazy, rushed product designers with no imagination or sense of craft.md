LLMs can provide a ton of value to your business

	Slapping an LLM-backed chatbot onto the front of your product, using one of the major models either out-of-the-box, or via their API, does not automatically provide any value

		the chat UI has been replicated in seemingly every product out there

			just picking a new name for your bot out of a hat isn't a product feature

			that is the laziest product development I can imagine

		chat is great when it exactly matches the use case, but most of the time it does not

			unimaginative product leaders and designers are just copying what is out there

			the companies developing the models, hoping to find revenue that can sustain that development, were also just perpetuating the first and most obvious UX pattern for leveraging the models (chat, and now voice, which is the same thing)

		chat is boring, lazy UX design, perpetuated throughout the AI product bubble

	Just using the base models provides no additional value over your customers just using those providers' products directly, in fact it might be worse if you've half-assed your initial prompt instructions

		using an LLM in the context of your business value requires

			understanding the additional tech (e.g. RAG and vector DBs) required to leverage your business' intelligence/context

			extensive prompt engineering and temperature defaults

			extensive training

[how dark mode killed good design - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iMTD0vDxQA)

> Dark mode has gone too far and it's killing good design. Last week when I was supposed to be finishing up this video, Apple launched iOS 18 and with it an update to dark mode, specifically dark mode icons with an optional tint. I lost another week just trying to figure out why it bugged me so much.

> I thought it was because of the way he clearly doesn't think it's cool, it's prerecorded. He could have done it again. But I think it's actually because unlike previous dark mode updates, this time, they never specify who they think this is useful for. Now, usually when the use case isn't obvious, the answer is accessibility, which is great, except that can't possibly be the case here because the photo they used to announce the dark mode tint feature doesn't comply with the web content accessibility guidelines. Instead, it feels like they've kind of lost sight of what people actually want from dark mode. And part of me can't even blame them because over the past 40 years, dark mode has come to represent so many different things. Terminal heritage, high contrast, battery efficiency, low brightness, simplification, and more. Those are a lot of valid design considerations, but the issue is that Apple didn't wanna consider them. **This update feels like Apple doing the bare minimum and leaving the onus on users to figure out how to actually make it useful. It's this laziness that I found increasingly common in so many apps and services that become so obsessed with offering new features that they've stopped considering how a person, an individual is going to use them all, which makes all of those options that once represented good design an opportunity for companies to offload their UX work onto us.** Or maybe all personalization is a good thing and I'm just overthinking it. But either way, have a lovely day.
