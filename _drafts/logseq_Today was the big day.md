We kicked off Q4. I would rate our performance as a leadership team as strictly par. There was a really good video about our culture produced in the last couple of weeks. In the video, one of the cofounders tears up and it's a great moment. There were a few participants in the talks that really stood out. One of our two-woman HR department spoke on her diversity and inclusion initiative. She said something to the effect of, "When I come to work, I don't feel like I have to hide my light, and I want that for everyone who comes to work here." It was really touching.
The kickoff was at a coworking space's conference center on the first floor of a building down the street from our office. Lunch was in the coworking space itself, on the 17th floor. I rode up the elevator with some KPMG employees headed to the 16th floor. One was complaining bitterly to his colleagues about another of their coworkers who had apparently been recently promoted. It was like he was pulled straight out of Office Space or some similar satire of modern knowledge work. I randomly mentioned this in my talk as an aside and observed how nice it is to work for our company in contrast. I think that comment might have received more audience feedback than any of my planned remarks.
