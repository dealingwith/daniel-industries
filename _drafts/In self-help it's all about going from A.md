In self-help it's all about going from A to B: I have a problem--I'm not writing a book, I don't have a relationship, whatever. I'm at A and I want to get to B. I want to get to this place but I can't.

...Self-help will generally go, "Here are some tips here's some advice..." but it doesn't work

...I want to come back to a very religious term Grace. What is Grace?

Grace is the idea of not moving from A to B, so it's fundamentally anti-self-help, anti-ideological. It goes, "No you don't move anywhere." Grace is: you're accepted absolutely in your shitness...It's the acceptance that you're accepted....when you experience Grace, you experience this radical acceptance that you don't have to do anything--that the frenetic pursuit, you don't have to engage in it. 

So Grace is: you don't go from A to B you stay at A and you realize that A does not equal A. 

...So suddenly you start just seeing this stuff, you start putting words to it, symbolizing it, and here's the trick: the trick is by doing that, it weakens the symptomatic dimension...

So ironically self-help, which is always trying to get you from A to B, is always failing because it doesn't take into consideration the enjoyment that you're getting from [failure] but in Grace, where you don't have to do anything, you encounter yourself in your own divisions, you can develop a curiosity with your own unconscious and you can kind of move forward.

What we're talking about is how do you create communities of Grace as opposed to ideological spaces of self-help.
