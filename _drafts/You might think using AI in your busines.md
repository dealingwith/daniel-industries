You might think using AI in your business might save you time and development cost, but you'd be wrong

"AI" (usually Generative AI, and henceforth referred to simply as AI) is, of course, all the rage right now. It might be easy to think that if you do not get on the bandwagon, your competition will leave you in the dust, having implemented AI in some magical way that puts them ahead of you in the marketplace.

You might even think that AI will help you create software, even if that software is the old, boring, garden-variety kind. AI will speed up your current software developers, allow your product designers to create full-fledged applications, and prevent you from having to grow your developer team in the future, while still pumping out software at the same rate.

Here are some things you might want to keep in mind as you allow this temptation to take root:

Software that adds AI functionality is still More Software. More software requires time (money) to build, test, and most importantly, maintain. The models and APIs your developers are using today will be out of date in months, and the changes (if recent history is any indication) will be significant. Even after your developers update their code to the new spec, the results coming from that AI API will probably be significantly different. You might even have to revisit the entire system around the AI -- the UX, the piece of the ETL chain, or the analyst dashboards that now have no continuity and create more confusion than they do insight.

I've been using GitHub Copilot off and on since it was released, and have a mostly favorable view on its capabilities, as long as the user knows what they're doing in the first place. But you know what it can't do? Write AI apps. Seemingly because the APIs are changing so frequently. It will give you API v1 and v2 syntax all mixed together. It's hilarious.

Same goes for trying to use ChatGPT (4o!) to write anything with the OpenAI API.

People get really excited when a model writes a working program when the only times I've seen that work is when it is so bog standard that it is no different than copy-pasting from a GitHub repo.

Given the average number of edge cases in even the most standard web app, things go off the rails pretty fast.

Although the real deceit of "AI" c. 2024 isn't the tech and what it can or can't do. It's businesses still treating software development as a cost center, laying off devs at the same time they extol plans to build more features thanks to GenAI's ability to vomit boilerplate.

*It's the features that cost money, regardless of who wrote them.*

I want to start an anti-feature software movement, but not from a UX or engineering standpoint. From a business standpoint. Lean methodologies are a diet aimed at keeping the business healthy. But feature factories are more like a host nearly consumed by parasites. They need to be detoxed.

> ...thinks we'll need more technical product managers and less developers in the near future, which I think makes a ton of sense.

I think this will lead to further enshittification and increased bugs and security incidents. [Here's leading product thinker Marty Cagan talking about this problem 6 years ago](https://youtu.be/9dccd8lihpQ?t=1970&si=gIYBmxAuJy2HkRH4) and it seems to have only gotten worse since, and the AI fantasies of product and business people are only making it worse. Even if your PMs are "technical", they're not actually working with code, their understanding of how the technology works and could bring value to the business is primarily based on reading marketing materials. Unless there is a culture of and process for getting empowered software engineers involved in the product process, we're going to continue to have shitty software.
