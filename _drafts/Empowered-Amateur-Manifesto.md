#### Reclaiming Amateur

Amateur Hour is very much a work in progress, but I felt like something of an "official" launch with an introduction was in order. I still don't know what this column wants to be when it grows up, but here's a stab at defining where we're headed. And while it's not quite a manifesto and might be a lot to digest at one sitting, it does attempt to lay out just what we think is afoot.

#### Death to Consumers

Mass media in the last half of the twentieth century turned us all into entertainment consumers; taking away much of our natural, human inclination to creativity as singers, pianists and storytellers. Who could be funnier than Carol Burnett or more charming than Johnny Carson?  Will the nieces and nephews sit still for Uncle Joe's guitar when they're used to hearing Doc Watson or Eric Clapton or B.B. King?  Why compete?  Better to take a backseat becoming a passive consumer and sharing jokes from the previous night’s broadcasts around the water cooler. But as the twenty-first century dawns, mass media has fragmented, professional quality production tools have become desktop commodities given away with the purchase of a new camera. Paired with a dearth of innovative "professional" content these changes have led to a quiet, but quite real, revolution in the quantity and quality of "amateur" content.

#### Power to the People

Pop culture, while still a touchstone of common experience, is no longer the model for what we should be, but is instead a starting point for ironic riffs and cut-up performance art. Mass media long ago turned from uplifting mankind to catering to the lowest common denominator. But without the straightjacket of FCC regulations, Web content can always go lower and be more “real”. More positively; without advertisers’ demands for “reach”, individuals can aspire to the most intimate, emotional artistic visions. Andy Warhol’s 15 minutes of fame is closer at hand than ever before; whether in the unintentional camp of Mahir’s I kiss you, or truly beautify “amateur” content like spiders, megatokyo, nowhere girl or {fray}

#### Two Visions of the Future

Despite the best efforts of multinational media conglomerates (what I call "Big Content") to turn the Internet into television, the broadband Web is rapidly becoming a personal two-way medium that is revolutionizing human communication. This may sound like an echo of the breathless dotcom bubble and for the hundreds of millions for whom the basics of human survival are a daily struggle it may sound frivolous. But this isn't a sales pitch to a venture capitalist, and while the digital divide surely exists, the lowered bar of access means that the stories of the left behind are that much more accessible. What's more, all of humanity surely benefits with the broadening of access to the power of free expression.

The revolution is occurring in two separate, but interrelated areas:

#### The Rebirth of Storytelling

The dot bomb, despite the human cost in jobs and retirement accounts, has left behind tangible benefits. The deployment of a global broadband interactive network, which projected interactive TV profits could never justify, has been largely completed - and the people who were chasing after a quick buck have moved on. Millions of average people are becoming their own media companies with inexpensive digital still and video cameras. Digital video and audio production software that is comparable to the tools I was using professionally less than a decade ago are priced under $100. Lightweight content management and publishing tools abound. Whether blogging, creating flash animations, web commix or inventive hybrids, more and more people are turning off their TV and being inspired to make cool stuff instead. 

A groundswell of amateurs and auteurs are already competing with Big Content companies for the attention of the masses. At some point films like the 405 and Rustboy will be competing for “consumers’” wallets as well. While Big Content is trying to convince us that larger, higher resolution screens and more channels of audio are what is important, tens of thousands of people are bringing the emotional impact of personal storytelling to digital media. Which matters more?  You be the judge.

#### A Revolution in Knowledge Working

The same tools that are empowering individual digital storytellers are enabling a real revolution in business communication and knowledge work. Email has become a critical component of business infrastructure, but the tools that we're using are essentially unchanged from 20 years ago. Microsoft Outlook's shared calendars and an integrated email client are the only substantive features that Borland's Sidekick lacked in 1984.

Instant messaging, ubiquitous connectivity (SMS, two-way paging, etc), project blogging, k-logs, XML and other technologies are going to allow us to turn the computer from a replacement for the secretarial pool into a tool for collaborative knowledge working. While not developed for knowledge workers, it is obvious that the same tools and talents that are re-shaping the “consumer” media landscape will revolutionize business communication at the same time.

#### An Invitation

My background, combining technical skills with business and marketing experience in the development of consumer multimedia, Web-enabled applications, wireless and broadband applications is broad, but necessarily shallow, assuredly leaving me with blind spots. But while opinionated, I'm not stubborn (my wife might disagree); I believe in claiming guilt and sharing credit. So feel free to correct me when I'm wrong and open my eyes to the obvious things I miss.

If you're sitting closer to the front of the boat than I, please warn me if you see any rocks. If you're steering, I hope you know where we're going. Me?  I'm bending an oar in the middle of the boat, taking notes on where we've been and keeping an eye on the cooler to make sure we don't run out of beer. It's going to be a fun trip, and we're all going to get soaked before we get where we're going.
