Angie is not an addict. She can quit anytime.

Angie lives sometimes in a deserted house in Arlington. Sometimes at her friend Rodger’s house. Rodger isn’t an addict either. He works for the government and has a nice flat in Arlington.

When Angie spends the night at the house, she wakes up to the birds chirping, a huge building made out of the glass her window lacks. She climbs out of said window and scavenges a little behind the various food establishments on Wilson.

When Angie spends the night at the flat, she steps out onto the balcony, smokes them if she’s got them, and wonders about all the people with normal lives across the street in the next high-rise building of flats.

Angie is not an addict. She’s not that stinky all the time.


…


Rodger isn’t a liar. He just needs to keep up pretenses.

Rodger doesn’t really work for the government. The government, to the best of his limited knowledge about such things, doesn’t hire gay sexual predators with heroin issues. Rodger is a rent-a-cop at a major upscale suburban mall near DC.

He does live in Arlington and Angie does come over a few days a week.

Sex?

You’re kidding, right?

Heroin is way better than sex.

Airec is the dark horse. Not literally, of course. That’s a figure of speech. 

He’s a POC. That’s Paranoid Obsessive Compulsive for those of you not in the know.

When Airec was 6 (or was it 8?) his mother ditched him for good while they were shopping at a major upscale suburban mall near DC.

He’s been wandering the malls 5 days a week looking for her ever since.

There are also a few other things about Airec that are good to know ahead of time.

He won’t step on street grates. They might give way and cause him to fall a good story and a half, possibly five to six, down into the subway.

He won’t step foot into a Starbucks. Starbucks is in cahoots with the federal government and the CIA has cameras installed in every Starbucks worldwide. Even Beijing. Especially Beijing. This is why only the most blind can step into a Starbucks. The most resigned. They don’t mind being watched for the consumption duration of their iced grande skim raz latte.

And there is one more thing: Airec doesn’t need the needle. Literally. He gains enough comfort hanging out with people on the stuff that he doesn’t actually ever feel the need to use himself. He just prefers junkies’ company. He finds their personalities comforting.

…


And they hugged. They hugged tight. They hugged so that Rodger couldn't breathe; or was it wouldn't breathe; time stopped and the breath held onto itself for eternity. For in that moment of time arrested, energy folded in from his arms to the center of his body and shot out the top of his head like a fountain and he felt like maybe he would just fall asleep in this beautiful feeling.

And then he had to breathe. But he didn't want to.

Exhale.

Micha is 47 years old. She's got a man's name, so she thinks. But it's just as well. She has a man's profession: she's a thief. Today she slipped into a gated community behind someone and traded in her Astro van for a nice new Lexus. No one looked twice. She's got a nice beehive, plenty of the gaudy gold that people her age seem to love so much. She looks like she has two boys in college. Oh, wait; she does have two boys in college. 

This job she pulled today, for example, is what Micha calls the "soccer mom." After her morning routine--CNN, a pot of coffee, masturbation, and an hour in front of the mirror with Cover Girl--she decides what to do with her day. Today it was cars, so she called up her first car guy. We'll call him Vinnie. She has a system, you see. She has a list of about 20 names--just for cars--and she cycles through that list. One phone call is it and she's on to the next one. If Vinnie hadn't been home today, it would have been on to the next guy. We'll call him Joe. Micha never works with women. Women criminals are all bitches. It would inevitably lead to a fight. Fisticuffs. Why when bitches fight it's called a catfight she'll never know.

Names are constantly on and off the list. So-and-so goes to jail. Vinnie knows of so-and-so who's reliable. Micha has a set of questions for any new contact. She can sniff out a rat or a pig in two minutes flat. It's like when Dr. Drew and Adam ask a bunch of stupid questions when new callers dial Loveline. Yeah, just like that. Dumbasses fall for it every time. So your baseball coach felt you up, huh? What position do you play?

And this is only the cars list. She only does cars about once a week. Vinnie won't get another call for five months. Hopefully he's not in jail by then. He's a pushover. Micha gave him a blowjob once two years ago and he's been giving her 10% more than anybody else since, hoping for some more head. Truth was, Micha was just in the mood and Vinnie looked like he had a pretty small dick.

Micha doesn't own a car or a house. She lives in motels or rentals and borrows a different car every day. Today's soccer mom was very standard fare. Take the bus to the poor part of town. Try not to look too out of place as the only white person around. Find an apartment building and find the nicest looking minivan in the parking lot. Pull that damn slim jim out from under the back of her blouse--she used to just carry it on the bus but she got sick of the looks. Pop the door--four seconds. Jumps in the van and throws the slim jim on the passenger seat. McDonalds trash on the floor. Slobs. Smells like black people--that combo of dry skin lotion and that shit they put in their hair to keep it from afroing. Micha is the only person in the world who grew up in an all-black neighborhood and became a racist. Scratch that. Micha hates everyone.

Two more tools come out the pocket--her special screwdriver and a hammer. She puts the screwdriver over the ignition and slams it hard with the hammer. She has a special technique of holding the screwdriver through the steering wheel. That way, if she misses the end of the screwdriver, the handle of the hammer hits the steering wheel before the head slams into her thumb. Nine times out of ten, anyway. This time, however, she's dead on the first time. Her screwdriver drives deep into the steering column. Now the hard part. She gives it a hard turn and only gets some cracking noise out of the steering column. That could be a good thing. She gives it another hard turn and the engine roars to life. She pumps the pedal a couple of times, knowing if the car stalls out she's all done.

Fuck that crossing wires shit. That's for the movies.

Some Brazilian music in the tape deck. That's nice.

Crank the AC. It's hot. Real fucking hot. Gotta get out of this godforsaken state.

Micha is greatly relieved as she pulls out of the parking lot. The hard part is over. Not that the chances of getting caught are any better--if anyone would call the cops from here, their response time is four times slower than for a call in the white neighborhood. But those poor people will come running out of their place screaming and kicking, sometimes shooting, and Micha hates that. Especially the screaming.

White people stay where they belong. Inside on the phone.

An eight block drive quite literally over the tracks to the gated community. Conveniently someone is pulling in. Micha comes in right behind--she just forgot her gate pass. One time this guy stopped right after going through the gate and the gate closed on Micha's rental. Paranoid old bastard!

Driving around, it's slim pickings--all the men drove the good cars to work today. Surely there are some self-respecting women in this place that require a proper vehicle when they go to the hairdresser! There's a BMW three-series. Who the fuck does that old lady think she is?!

Gonna have to pick a winner soon. A Lexus. Has to be the top of the line model. Yes.

Micha pulls into the empty driveway of the next-door neighbor. These places are all the same--the houses are two feet from each other and there are no windows on the sides of them so the neighbor can't film you screwing your lover at two in the afternoon. Not that you know your neighbor anyway. Just keep talking on the phone. Micha walks across the perfectly manicured lawn to the Lexus next-door. Same routine and in one minute flat she's pulling out of the driveway. 15 minutes later she's at Vinnie's. He's got that horny glint in his eye. Dumbass.

I live in New York City. I moved here about three years ago to launch my acting “career.” I spent the first three months soaking my savings in rent and espressos, then I started working at the coffee house; I figured it would help on both counts.

New York has been a funny town. I come from the Midwest, so I probably have a warped view, a skewed starting point. New York still has its scenes, its cliques. It still has its famous attitude; really it’s just the collective urban survival skills of millions of closely packed human beings. I came to find fame and fortune, mostly fame, however I was realistic and hoped for anything--and I mean anything--to pop up. Something like off-off-off-off-Broadway.

But it seems that since the Towers went down those five years ago, there has been a lurking depression and fatality to the place. That area of town, itself, is even more beautiful than ever, albeit significantly less distinct in the skyline. But it’s not even just that area of town, really; the whole place just has got a case of the stinky shivers, a reality bite.

As for me, work in my “real profession” has been scarce. I was cast in a passion play at the local Catholic church, but the entire thing had to be canned at the last minute when it was found out the actor who was to play Jesus was a homosexual pedophile. There was no understudy. That’s the last time the church will make that mistake. 

Things became particularly hard for me when, after just four months at the coffee shop, I, for some reason, thought it would be ok for me to force some clogged beans into the grinder with my bare hand. I lost most of three fingers. There was no sewing those things back on.

Here’s your decaf hazelnut for a cone filter, sir.

And from henceforth of that moment, I became one of this country’s secret underclass: the deformed. You wouldn’t think that just three halves of three fingers would be enough, but it is.

You’re auditioning for The Purple Dragon Gothic Playhouse’s “Dominance of Macbeth,” and you go to make that dramatic hand motion that perfectly accentuates the climax of your monologue, and,

“Thanks. We’ll be in touch.”


…

I’m 24 years old. I make 1500 dollars a month after taxes; I cancelled my dental insurance after the accident because after that shiny whites weren’t going to overshadow my lack of complete digits. And I don’t mean a phone number. Although I haven’t had one of those for about 7 months. I never did have health. Unfortunately I never got around to insuring my ass for billions. If I had I’d probly have three fingers all better than the other 7 originals.

My rent is 1350. I live in one room. Kitchen is one corner, living another, bedroom another, entry the fourth. I could really use another corner for the den, but a fifth corner wouldn’t leave any money for the generic corn flakes, Raman, and canned beans that make up my daily diet.

See, utilities average around 100; more in the winter, less in the summer. AC? Yeah. You’re joking. So this leaves 50 for food.

Monday: Breakfast--corn flakes, with milk if I remembered to steal some from the coffee shop. Lunch--coffee. Dinner--Raman noodles. Tuesday: Breakfast--corn flakes, definitely forgot to steal some milk. Lunch--coffee. Dinner--canned beans. And so on. 

I live alone because no one would ever offer to be my roommate. They either

    1. Would be confused and paranoid about my sexual orientation--and they wouldn’t be the only one--and have nightmares about waking up with their anal sphincters gaping wide and covered in Vaseline or
    2. Be driven away by “the smell.”

Yeah, ‘cause after breakfast and dinner, $0 is left for clothes and cleaning products.

…
So the daily grind continued, quite literally, for many years. Until I heard about this play. Rob and the Dancer it was called, and it was the biggest thing to hit New York theater since the turn of the millennium. 
…

It was a phenomena of sorts. It played in this tiny theater. It was awash in secrecy. It was conceptualized years ago, but took years to realize, both technologically and legally. 

Tickets were expensive. Really expensive. Four digit expensive. Show times were irregular and only finally known by ticket holders.

It wasn’t until two British papers, ironically on either side of the socio-political spectrum, the Guardian and the Sun, broke the story of what Rob and the Dancer was really about, that the general public knew why the secrecy. But most of them disregarded it as either a falsehood cooked up for publicity or a product of some deviant underground culture of little relevance.

I’m here to tell you it is neither.
