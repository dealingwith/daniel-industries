Angie is not an addict. She can quit anytime.

Angie lives sometimes in a deserted house in Arlington. Sometimes at her friend Rodger’s house. Rodger isn’t an addict either. He works for the government and has a nice flat in Arlington.

When Angie spends the night at the house, she wakes up to the birds chirping, a huge building made out of the glass her window lacks. She climbs out of said window and scavenges a little behind the various food establishments on Wilson.

When Angie spends the night at the flat, she steps out onto the balcony, smokes them if she’s got them, and wonders about all the people with normal lives across the street in the next high-rise building of flats.

Angie is not an addict. She’s not that stinky all the time.


…


Rodger isn’t a liar. He just needs to keep up pretenses.

Rodger doesn’t really work for the government. The government, to the best of his limited knowledge about such things, doesn’t hire gay sexual predators with heroin issues. Rodger is a rent-a-cop at a major upscale suburban mall near DC.

He does live in Arlington and Angie does come over a few days a week.

Sex?

You’re kidding, right?

Heroin is way better than sex.


…


Airec is the dark horse. Not literally, of course. That’s a figure of speech. 

He’s a POC. That’s Paranoid Obsessive Compulsive for those of you not in the know.

When Airec was 6 (or was it 8?) his mother ditched him for good while they were shopping at a major upscale suburban mall near DC.

He’s been wandering the malls 5 days a week looking for her ever since.

There are also a few other things about Airec that are good to know ahead of time.

He won’t step on street grates. They might give way and cause him to fall a good story and a half, possibly five to six, down into the subway.

He won’t step foot into a Starbucks. Starbucks is in cahoots with the federal government and the CIA has cameras installed in every Starbucks worldwide. Even Beijing. Especially Beijing. This is why only the most blind can step into a Starbucks. The most resigned. They don’t mind being watched for the consumption duration of their iced grande skim raz latte.

And there is one more thing: Airec doesn’t need the needle. Literally. He gains enough comfort hanging out with people on the stuff that he doesn’t actually ever feel the need to use himself. He just prefers junkies’ company. He finds their personalities comforting.

…

Johnny happened to be in town.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” were his exact words. 

He was sprawled out on Rodger’s couch, dirty and itchy, as usual. Johnny was the kind of guy that made you afraid he was going to start masturbating in public at any second.

Anyway, he was in town for the weekend.

…

Johnny's superlatives were in response to Rodger's rather clumsy introduction to a story he intended to tell, of his day at the mall; a day not unlike many other days but worth the story anyway; a day slightly different, if different was the even right word.

…


And they hugged. They hugged tight. They hugged so that Rodger couldn't breathe; or was it wouldn't breathe; time stopped and the breath held onto itself for eternity. For in that moment of time arrested, energy folded in from his arms to the center of his body and shot out the top of his head like a fountain and he felt like maybe he would just fall asleep in this beautiful feeling.

And then he had to breathe. But he didn't want to.

Exhale.

…

Angie was just leaving.

She opened the door of Rodger’s apartment to a rush of hallway air released from its stagnant existence to the world outside the open porch sliding-glass door.

Like any night, it was a toss-up between stepping off said porch for a quick and permanent introduction to the concrete 13 floors below and said front door.

She shouted goodbye to Rodger, still high and half-comatose on the bedroom floor and let the door slam shut behind her.

She was shocked by the steel elevator-button plate, just like every time. Since she was high, the electricity kind of felt good going through her hand and up to her elbow. Angie imagined the blue icicle then shooting across to the wall opposite, her body simply a conduit to the eternal living thing; this energy that never seems to just stay with her, it always must go on, moving on to the starving kids in South America, the children that pick the poppies that then fuel her existence.

The elevator door opened. Angie entered and hit P like she had a thousand times before.

With an uncharacteristic lurch, the lift began descending.

For about 2 seconds.

Then it stopped, with yet another uncharacteristic fit of violence.

Angie, our hero, high as a kite, then had about another 10 seconds to figure out what to do. The normal thing would be to hit the red button. Whatever the red button does, surely this was the time to hit it.

But in 10 seconds, heroes can’t think of this sort of thing. Heroes, thanks to special cinemagraphic techniques now employed in Hollywood, have full minutes to jump up, spin around, and kick the teeth out of the bad guy. Or, in this case, get stuck in an elevator and hit the red button.

Hit the red button.

The elevator then began shaking. Left to right, then back to the left. Up a little. Then a pause.

You know those fast elevators they have exclusively in New York City? Yeah. Multiply that by your favorite large interval.

When you are enclosed in a free falling container, you float. It really is quite literally NASA training.

The problem is this plane doesn’t gradually regain altitude.
