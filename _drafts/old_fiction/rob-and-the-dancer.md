Rob and the Dancer

I remember the first time I saw the play. I knew I had to be in it. I knew I had to be a part of it. I knew that it was my destiny. Never again to be in the daily grind.

Literally. I worked at a coffee shop.

When I first saw that play, my heart burned within my chest with such a fire that the flames got real high and singed my medulla oblongata. It took a while for my brain to reconnect; it took a couple days for my ears to again hear the voice of reason over the screaming of my soul.

I just knew that that is what I had to do with my life.

...

I need to back up a little bit. First, a few facts:

I live in New York City. I moved here about three years ago to launch my acting “career.” I spent the first three months soaking my savings in rent and espressos, then I started working at the coffee house; I figured it would help on both counts.

New York has been a funny town. I come from the Midwest, so I probably have a warped view, a skewed starting point. New York still has its scenes, its cliques. It still has its famous attitude; really it’s just the collective urban survival skills of millions of closely packed human beings. I came to find fame and fortune, mostly fame, however I was realistic and hoped for anything--and I mean anything--to pop up. Something like off-off-off-off-Broadway.

But it seems that since the Towers went down those five years ago, there has been a lurking depression and fatality to the place. That area of town, itself, is even more beautiful than ever, albeit significantly less distinct in the skyline. But it’s not even just that area of town, really; the whole place just has got a case of the stinky shivers, a reality bite.

Stinky Shivers: a slang term, highly localized to some unknown region of the Midwest, which refers to the fear and dread combination feeling that rises up in a person walking through a cow pasture who stops suddenly, realizing they just squarely stepped into a fresh cow paddy.

Reality Bite: another highly localized slang term. It may or may not have anything to do with an overly hyped film of the mid-1990’s later used, along with other films and books of the time and genre, to label a generation.

As for me, work in my “real profession” has been scarce. I was cast in a passion play at the local Catholic church, but the entire thing had to be canned at the last minute when it was found out the actor who was to play Jesus was a homosexual pedophile. There was no understudy. That’s the last time the church will make that mistake. 

Things became particularly hard for me when, after just four months at the coffee shop, I, for some reason, thought it would be ok for me to force some clogged beans into the grinder with my bare hand. I lost most of three fingers. There was no sewing those things back on.

Here’s your decaf hazelnut for a cone filter, sir.

And from henceforth of that moment, I became one of this country’s secret underclass: the deformed. You wouldn’t think that just three one-halves of three fingers would be enough, but it is.

You’re auditioning for The Purple Dragon Gothic Playhouse’s “Dominance of Macbeth,” and you go to make that dramatic hand motion that perfectly accentuates the climax of your monologue, and,

“Thanks. We’ll be in touch.”

...

I’m sorry. I really do apologize. I haven’t even introduced myself yet and I’ve shared “way too much information.”

My name is Timothy James Sutton. I know, it could be a black name, but it’s not. I’m white. White as snow. Snow that’s had the first three fingers of its right hand ground off.

I’m 24 years old. I make 1500 dollars a month after taxes; I cancelled my dental insurance after the accident because after that shiny whites weren’t going to overshadow my lack of complete digits. And I don’t mean a phone number. Although I haven’t had one of those for about 7 months either. I never did have health insurance. Unfortunately, I never got around to insuring my ass for billions, J-Lo. If I had I’d probly have three fingers all better than the other 7 originals.

My rent is 1350. I live in one room. Kitchen is one corner, living another, bedroom another, entry the fourth. I could really use another corner for the den, but a fifth corner wouldn’t leave any money for the generic corn flakes, Raman, and canned beans that make up my daily diet.

See, utilities average around 100; more in the winter, less in the summer. AC? Yeah. You’re joking. So this leaves 50 for food.

Monday: Breakfast--corn flakes, with milk if I remembered to steal some from the coffee shop. Lunch--coffee. Dinner--Raman noodles. Tuesday: Breakfast--corn flakes, definitely forgot to steal some milk. Lunch--coffee. Dinner--canned beans. And so on. 

I live alone because no one would ever offer to be my roommate. They either

    1. Would be confused and paranoid about my sexual orientation--and they wouldn’t be the only one--and have nightmares about waking up with their anal sphincters gaping wide and covered in Vaseline or
    2. Be driven away by “the smell.”

Yeah, ‘cause after breakfast and dinner, $0 is left for clothes and cleaning products.

...

But again I must apologize. Again I’m telling you more than I should, or you want to hear. I’m so embarrassed. I just don’t know when to shut up sometimes.

So the daily grind continued, quite literally, for many years. Until I heard about this play. Rob and the Dancer it was called, and it was the biggest thing to hit New York theater since the turn of the millennium. 

It was a phenomena of sorts. It played in this tiny theater. It was awash in secrecy. It was conceptualized years ago, but took years to realize, both technologically and legally. 

Tickets were expensive. Really expensive. Four digit expensive. Show times were irregular and only finally known by ticket holders.

It wasn’t until two British papers, ironically on either side of the socio-political spectrum, the Guardian and the Sun, broke the story of what Rob and the Dancer was really about, that the general public knew why the secrecy. But most of them disregarded it as either a falsehood cooked up for publicity or a product of some deviant underground culture of little relevance.

I’m here to tell you it is neither.

Rob and the Dancer is, as they say, a “mystery wrapped in an enigma.” It is an exquisite piece of creative genius, a technological marvel, and a piece of live entertainment never before seen. It is sure to have it’s imitators, but Rob was the first.

Of course I’m playing the lead in it this evening, so I might be a little biased.

Of course I’ve been put up in the nicest hotel in all of Manhattan and fed like a pig being stuffed for the slaughter, so I might be a little biased. 

Of course I’m sent beautiful women (or men, it depends on one's interests) every night who know such depths of passion I…well…

So I might be a little biased.

It happens.

It still doesn’t change the fact that hundreds of people have paid thousands of dollars each to see the most famous (or infamous, it depends on one's interests) play in history.

...

Even the casting call was like a maze. First, it wasn’t publicized in the normal trade papers, websites, or NewsWirelesstm service. I found out about it, finally, through this ad.



It was such a strange advert to begin with! So obviously doctored--not even trying to hide it. And such strange language…it really didn’t make any sense at all to me, but I decided to pursue it anyway. I figured I’d noticed it, might as well. Turns out they paid a team of psychologists big bucks to create these things to draw in the “right” kind of people.

Little did I know how it would pay off.

Of course, the entire process has changed so much, the way I initially found it is probably no good anymore, and there are probably new secret passageways to the inside.

But these “entry points,” as they called them, are just the beginning. What happened after is the real story.

...

I guess you could say that Rob attracted the same kind of people as porn does; you know, blond, normally kind of low-grade ugly but made beautiful under the airbrush and your lust. People from small towns in the Midwest with big stars in their eyes but never the connections to make it happen. Transplanted people, far from what they were trained/brought up to understand as true reality, grasping at anything to pull them up into their dreams, to pull them out from their hell. Desperate people. Like me.

I guess that you could say that Rob was like porn, or any movies for that matter, or premanufactured pop music, or Prada shoe models, or anything else you might find in the important literature of our era: Rolling Stone, GQ, Spin, People, Premier, Vanity Fair, The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, Cosmo, Muscle & Fitness, Esquire, Entertainment Weekly, The Source, Q, O, Maxim, Vogue, Stuff, Harpers, Glamour, InStyle, Allure, Elle, Shape, Self, Teen, Seventeen, and Young Miss.

That is, you wanted to be a part of it, even if it killed you. You would die trying. 

You had to. It was your dream, your drive, your reason for being.

It was the only way you were ever going to be loved. 

Loved, that is, at least enough to counter balance your insecurities.

...

I’m actually not allowed to tell you any of this stuff about the casting call and the auditions and the practices and the accommodations. I’m actually in breach of my contract right now. But what the hell. I’m about to go on. They can’t fire me now.

...

When I called brother, he was understandably unamused. 

“What the fuck are you thinking?” I think were his exact words.

My brother never minces words.

He then went on to go off about how stupid it was for me to leave home in the first place, going to New York to be poor and deformed, taken advantage of, and desperate; all of which culminated with the scheme I had just described to him, imploring him to help me by participating.

You see, Rob required brothers.

I told him in no uncertain terms which part I would play, and the benefits he would gain, the treatment he would receive. 

He told me I was crazy.

I told him this was my calling. I told him I would do nothing else with my life but this. I told him he would either help me be in this play or I would kill myself.

He told me I had become one of those New York fatalists. All the terror threats had gone to my head. I was too ready to bet it all.

I told him it was my destiny. I told him I would be famous. I told him he would be rich.

He mumbled something.

I said nothing.

He said, “Ok. What the hell. If that’s what you want. I can’t stop you.”

I said, “Great. Now, we need to make plans. You need to be here for the audition. This is the only thing you’ll have to pay for, I promise.”

“Ok. No problem. I’ll be there in two days.”

And with that, by brother packed up some stuff, got into his red extra-cab pickup truck, and drove across half the country to join me in New York. He parked in Jersey-- somewhere his Palm told him was the best cost-to-distance ratio from my apartment--and took the train in. It seemed like I had just hung up the phone and he was knocking on my door. My heart jumped a little bit--adrenaline--we were really going to do this.

...

When he walked in, unless you knew, you might not even take us for brothers. Back home all those years ago, we were identical. Now, he was huge. I was gaunt. He had presence. I disappeared into corners. He walked tall. I slithered. I was going to offer him the bed, but upon the sight of me, he denied it, insisting instead that I continue to use it. He spread a blanket on the only few square feet of free floor space in the studio--and used that as a place to sleep.

I had already arranged almost everything with the audition, so the next day I made a phone call and we were scheduled for later that afternoon. We arrived at the dark Village loft and were led to a small stage facing a handful of folding chairs. Our guide was a 20-something man dressed in black jeans and a long-sleeved black tee-shirt. He had a short beard and well-trimmed hair. I looked punk-ass next to him, and brother looked like a first-rate hick. After confirming our identities at the door, he had not said a word until depositing us at a rehersal stage and disappearing stage right. Soon after--just long enough to make brother and I quite nervous--he and a trio made up of two similar looking males and one striking, business-like woman entered the room. They all took their seats on the folding chairs before us. There were exactly enough chairs for the four of them.


Since I had found them in the first place, and filled out all the applications, I answered all their questions, most of which were repeats from the application. They had a hard time believing at first that we were in fact brothers, but I assured them that with proper diet we would in no time be identical again. There was some mumbling about makeup being necessary, but other than that there was nothing to be too concerned about.

Except of course my hand.

But they mentioned something about a prosthetic and seemed to be happy enough with that. The air in the room became lighter and I sensed their confidence in brother and I increasing. I think they were more concerned with my dedication; and upon their determination of that, the hand, for the first time since the accident, became a non-issue. Something that could be worked around.

The rest of that day and the next were a blur. By the following evening, brother and I were put into a fantastic hotel in downtown Manhattan. We had a huge two bedroom suite with soft sheets on the beds and terry robes in the bathrooms. We ordered the biggest dinner I’d ever seen in my life and devoured it until we were bloated so much we couldn’t budge from the couch. My studio apartment and the coffee shop were a distant memory. History.

Later that night, as brother and I were still laid out on the couch watching pay-per-view, there was a knock at the door, and upon opening the door, we were treated to the sight of two knockouts. These two blond bombshells in extremely tight, short dresses actually knew our names and quickly introduced themselves as friends. It was like the movies, or a dream.

They hung out with us for a couple hours, talking and flirting like crazy. I felt alive again, amazingly alive, their attention filling back up my empty fuel cells like a Texas power station. Brother and I soaked it in, brother obviously more experienced at this type of thing than I. He made his move and before I knew it he had one of the girls in his bedroom for the night. 

I was not so adept, nor sure about what was reality and what fantasy. Two nights prior I had choked down generic baked beans for the two-hundredth time. Tonight I had a beautiful woman touching my thigh. My heart was finally beating again, but my head was spinning. I started to get lightheaded. In an awkward string of excuses and strange body language, I saw the potential fulfillment of years of sexual frustration, a perfect body and an undoubtedly amazing lover, out the door. She smiled politely and went, I can only assume, home to her studio apartment.


Rehearsals were pretty routine. Dialogue only took a couple days to get down pat. After that the director and his assistants were mostly concerned with our movements on stage, our body language, and, of course, the technology.

Rob took advantage of the absolute latest hologrammic technology. While the producers did not allow us to see a video of prior runnings of the show--something I thought would have been very useful, but apparently it was a case of the fact that they did not want any video to even exist--they did give us extensive looks at both the technology--the high-luminosity projectors, special “dense-air” mirrors (that is the layman’s term for the devises, which had limited use within certain government “industries”), and the never- before-seen-by-the-public silicon-textile “graphs” that the actors were to wear to help with the illusion--and its use within the show. They spent an entire day with us, explaining how all of it worked together, showing us the angles, where the equipment sat within the theater, where we had to be for it to work properly, exactly how we had to move. I actually had a pretty easy part. I would be done acting at the precise moment all the technology came into play. 

No pun intended.

Anyway, all I had to do was wear a special shirt.

This kind of thing had been done on film for years, but pulling it off live was another technological feat altogether. 

I’m seriously just about to go on, so we’re going to have to wrap this up quick.

In fact…shit…here comes my stage manager, Judy. This is it. I’m going to be famous. I gotta go.

NANCY: See you .

{WILLIAM exits. . .Before he gets completely off stage, lights go out} 

{Voice from offstage}: Ladies and gentlemen, "Rob and the Dancer.”

Act II

SCENE: A beach on a deserted island. The sea is a very dark blue, and a thick jungle grows out from the sand of the beach, providing a sharp contrast of sand and vegetation. WILLIAM is now in character as ROB. He wears the tattered suit and lays face down on the stage. He looks rather disheveled and has a day's growth on his face. After the lights come up, he pushes himself up to his knees. He spits out a wad of wet sand .from his mouth, disgustingly, and holds his head. 

ROB: Where am I? God , my head! 

{He checks for wounds or blood by examining his head with his fingers} 

What happened? Where am I? 

{He turns his head from side to side and stares at his surroundings in amazement.} 

Where the hell am I? 

{He brings himself to his feet and looks down over his battered body and tattered suit} 

God, my suit! 

{He smells his pi ts. } 

Wow! Where have I been? Where am I? 

{He again looks from side to side, with an even more distressed look. He surveys his body and his situation. He buries his face in his hands and weeps violently. He slowly goes down to his knees, and then down to his face. His weeping becomes less and less violent until he is not crying at all. Finally, he moves his hands, turns his head, and it is apparent he has fallen asleep. } 

{The lights go out for just long enough to get WILLIAM wet.}

{ROB wakes up again after the lights are back up. He slowly rises to his knees again. Now his suit is soaked from the waist down.} 

Where am I? Man, do I itch! Oh , and I'm all wet from laying in the current! 

{ROB faces the crowd and his eyes are drawn to the left, as the BALLERINA enters. She wears a pink silk blouse, a tutu, and dancing shoes. She appears very pale and clean. Her lips are overly red. She slowly dances her way towards ROB. He is obviously shocked at the sight of another human being ..ROB rises to his feet. } 

Hey! I'm so glad to see someone else! You wouldn't believe...anyway, where am I? Who 
are YOu? 

{ROB begin to realize that the BALLERINA is paying absolutely no attention to him. She stares unemotionally straight ahead. ROB begins to yell.} 

Hey! Over here! Are you deaf? I'm right here! Are you blind? Right here! Look at me! What are you doing? Please say something?! Do something!? 

{The BALLERINA has now passed him without so much as a glance .He bends over and clutches his pant legs to rest. He's almost too out of breath to talk. He just looks over at the BALLERINA as she continues her way off stage. He stands up straight again and his jaw drops. His mouth closes after some time and he rubs his face with his hands .} 

What the hell was that? Shit... 

{ROB slowly and depressingly shuffles off stage right. Lights go out.} 

Act III 

SCENE: Somewhere in the thick forest of the island. ROB is exploring. He walks in circles while pushing away imaginary foliage. 

ROB: I'll show 'em. I'll show 'em. I'll show her. I'm gonna survive this thing. Whatever this thing is. I need answers. I need answers, damn it! Where am I? Why won't this headache go away? Why won't this scenery change? It looks the same no matter where I go! 

{He motions to the backgrounds.} 

It's like a damn video game. I'm getting sick watching it go by. And it is sick how quiet it is in here! Where the hell are the sounds?! Where are the animals? I don't know whether to be scared about the fact that there aren't any animals here or paranoid about the potential for some great big predator to be lurking in the shadows. Shit , Rob, now you're not making any sense! Are there even any flowers in here?!

{ROB makes one or two more circles, then stumbles upon a pond (lights fall on the pond located at the side of the stage). It is the size of a children's swimming pool and very clean (a mirror). He reacts with great joy and anticipation, running the last two steps until he arrives at its edge. He kneels at its edge and peers into it.} 

What joy! Fresh water! 

{He touches the (invisible) water and cups a handful, letting it fall back into the pond. Then he rises to his feet and observes himself in the reflection of the pond for a moment.} 

Yea, I'm the man. I'm lookin' pretty good. My hair is an my head. 

{He mumbles a few sentences} 

My face is clean. 

{He bends over and washes his face with the water. He straightens up and lifts his shirt to expose his stomach.} 

I've got the six pack . I'm the man. 

{long pause} 

I'm, sick! 

{ROB kneels once again and takes a long drink from the pond. He wipes his chin when he is finished and scoots backwards in order to lean against a tree. He folds his arms across his chest and closes his eyes.} 

{Lights go out for an instant.} 

{The BALLERINA enters stage left. She slowly dances her way across the stage as 
before. ROB awakes and is startled when he spots her across the stage.} 

ROB: Hey! You again! Hey! 

{He motions towards her as she approaches. She is again apparently oblivious to his presence. His pleas end quickly and he simply observes her as she floats on by. At the last second, she turns her head and looks unemotionally at him. He seems to perk up a little, but she quickly turns her head forward again and continues across the stage. He becomes even more irritated. He becomes angry.} 

Oh yea! Well you can just. ..{he mumbles something} 

{A short time passes with no action. Finally ROB stands up very straight, turns on his heel, and walks off stage left. The lights go out.} 

Act IV

SCENE: Back on the beach . ROB walks on from stage right.

ROB: Shit! I’m back at this God-forsaken beach. What am I going to do on this island with no place to go and nothing to eat and only one place with fresh water. I’m doomed {pause} Hey! How long have I been here? I wonder why it hasn’t gotten any darker? Where am I? Yikes! Better not think about that anymore.

{Rob plops down on the beach. He stares off into the sea. After a short time of this, he rises excitedly to his feet.}

A miracle! A miracle! A miracle! Something! Anything!

{ROB runs to stage right and pulls out a large chest. He drags it with a bit of trouble to center stage. He pries it open with relative ease and peers inside. He names the contents as he dumps them on the beach.}

A musket?! Powder? Blankets! Bread! Tons of bread! Flint. Steel. A machete. Yes! This is the mother lode. I’m set!

{ROB runs into the forest with his arms full of his bounty and humming “God Save the Queen.”}

Act V

SCENE: Back in the forest, next to the pond. ROB has his loot spread out on the ground. He’s built a lean-to and is trying to start a fire.

ROB: Damn the Boy Scouts! How does this work?

{He works without success with the flint and steel to light a small pile of green leaves and twigs.}

Oh, screw the fire.

{He grabs a loaf of bread and begins to eat. He eats about four large bites.”

Man, I’m full. I need a drink.

{He drinks from the pond and sits down again. He grabs the machete from the ground, leans back against a tree and stares hypnotically into the reflections in the machete.}

You’re ok. You’re ok. You have anesthetized your mind to the weirdness of your situation. You’re ok. You’ll make it. You’ll find help. A way out of here. Anything. Don’t worry about it.

{ROB stretches his mouth with a large yawn. Just as he is finished, the BALLERINA appears from the entranceway of the theater. She dances methodically to the stage and across it towards ROB, who is fingering the blade of his machete and staring sinisterly towards the BALLERINA. He begins to yell at her as she comes onto the stage.}

Robinson Eugene Corning isn’t doing too bad for himself now, eh? I’ll show you! I’ll show everyone! You don’t mess with the man! You don’t mess with me! You don’t mess with Robinson! You don’t mess with Robinson E. Corning! Ignoring me, eh? We’ll see just how far you get doing that! You won’t get nowhere! NOWHERE! You won’t make it. You ain’t the man.

{The BALLERINA glides right up to ROB and grins ear to ear. Rob gives a disgusted look back, shocked to see any response. She then turns her back to him and begins to walk away. His face turns to rage. He begins after her, his machete raised above his head, ready to strike. He lets out a homicidal scream. She spins around and puts a large sword through his neck, pinning him to a tree (backdrop). She lets go of the sword and watches ROB as he hangs there in silence. The machete falls and clanks loudly on the ground. Her face shows no emotion as blood flows down the tree and onto the ground. His face is mangled. He twitches one last time and is dead. The BALLERINA deliberately grips the sword once again.}

{Lights go out. When they are turned on again in an instant, CALVIN is in the exact same position the BALLERINA was in, gripping the sword. He looks and is dressed exactly like the late WILLIAM, save that his suit is new and clean. He pulls the blade from the tree and watches WILLIAM fall lifelessly to the floor. He turns on this heal and begins to march across the stage.}

THE NEW ROB: Next!

{He exits. The lights go out.}

Act VI

SCENE: It is four o’clock in NANCY’S dressing room. JAMES and KELVIN stand where WILLIAM had once stood. JAMES is dressed in a tattered suit and has a five o’clock shadow. KELVIN has a new, clean suit and is well groomed. NANCY is in her pink blouse and tutu.

JAMES: How were the two o’clock guys?
NANCY: They were pretty good. I think Calvin is still hanging around here somewhere.
KELVIN: Was he convincing as you?
NANCY: You mean as my character? Sure. I guess. I didn’t see that part, now that I think about it.
JAMES: I’m so nervous. There is so much to live up to in this play.
NANCY: Yes, but you’ll do fine. They always do fine.
JAMES: What?
NANCY: You always do fine. You’ll do your brother proud.
JAMES: Thank you.
NANCY: You’re welcome. {pause} How do they get all you guys, anyway?
KELVIN: What do you mean?
NANCY: How do they find so many fine twin actors?
JAMES: Well, it is, after all, the most popular play in the country, and it only plays in one place.
NANCY: Yes, I know. But still. You are never hesitant. You always come in. You always go out. You are always so proud. You are always so deliberate. You are always so…actful!
KELVIN: It’s our jobs.
NANCY: And I guess that is the final analysis. Big jobs equal big fame equal big time at the top. Well, I hope you all the best of luck.
JAMES: Thank you. I just hope I can do at least as well, if not better, than the two o’clock guy.
NANCY: Yes, well. {pause} How long do you guys rehearse?
JAMES: Three weeks.
NANCY: Wow. And you’ve never seen this play?
JAMES: No. But it’s reputation proceeds itself.
NANCY: Three weeks for this. {pause} Well, anyway, it’s not the two o’clock guys you need to worry about. There was this guy last week who was incredible. The best yet, and there has been a few to come around here. If you can top him…let’s just say that I’m staying in touch with his brother mostly on account of his performance.

{This evokes a smile from KELVIN.}

Awe-inspiring. {pause} Anyway, the best of luck to you both, again.

{Voice from offstage}: Curtain in five minutes.

JAMES: Well we’d better get going. We’ll let you make your final preparations and we’ll go make ours. I’ll see you in just a bit.
KELVIN: See you.
NANCY: See you.

{James and Kelvin exit. Before they get completely off stage, lights go out.}

{Voice from offstage}: Ladies and gentlemen, “Rob and the Dancer.”
