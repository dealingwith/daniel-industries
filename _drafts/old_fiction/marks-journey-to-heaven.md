“Maybe heaven will be like this,” Mark thought out loud as he walked through the doors, grabbed a cart (habit), and bounced it across the cheap textured tile that floors the entrance to every Wal-Mart in existence. “The lights whitewashing everything. All the people in a happy haze of pleasure, but never of the sexual variety.” His eyes shifted left to right, checking to see if anyone had heard him utter “sexual.” Of course they hadn’t; only God had.

Mark’s journey to heaven began ten years prior. Heart broken at the virgin age of 17. The girl was 18, a freshman in college. He coasted through the rest of his senior year the way he had spent the previous 11—immersed in his own world, a mishmash of stories from novels, role-playing games, and virtual online environments, woven together somewhere deep inside his mind.

About a year and a half later, when he should have been going to college but mostly just hung out with students in his college home town, Mark got saved. He’d begun casually participating in a radically evangelistic college church—some would call it a cult—early on in his faux-college career. Then one day if finally just clicked. 

Eventually Mark drifted out of the group, but was always drawn back in one capacity or another. Things just made sense there. It was the only place where things made sense.

The “drifting out”—some would call it backsliding—became more severe for the same reason it always did—a woman. Mark had continued to keep one foot in the online world of his youth, and through a 3D fantasy role-playing game met his soul mate, “littleevilblue,” who, it turned out, wasn’t even a  little evil, or blue. Although they never met, they would spend hours in the game, on IM, and emailing. This went on for months.

She ended up breaking his heart too.

Being a completely virtual relationship, the breakup was virtual, and the aftermath was virtual.

A few months later, Mark unsuccessfully tried to organize a mass online suicide on Valentine’s day.

A few months later, still in a haze of mourning, he returned to the church.

The thing to understand about this church, and its very charismatic preacher, is that every sermon is the same: Here’s an issue. Here’s the black. Here’s the white. Heaven and hell and your eternal soul is always involved. And afterwards, when you leave for Sunday brunch, you feel like a million bucks. 

That trip to church changed Mark’s life forever. He instantly changed. Things didn’t just click this time, they came together like two gears in the biggest clockworks in the world. He was never to log onto his computer again. His role-playing games sat lonely on the closet shelf. He spent the next week and half reading his Bible and whatever Christian books he had laying around the house.

And then he decided to go to Wal-Mart.

The thing to understand about Mark is he was a skeptic. A geek. A cynic. Yet his heart often steered the ship, as it were.

Mark was sick of not knowing. And he was sick of having his heart broken.

So he decided to go to Wal-Mart.

He ditched the cart in toiletries and mumbled to himself as he passed the closet organizers.

“Please Lord forgive me. Please Lord forgive me.”

A little bit louder as he passed the furniture.

“I just have to know. I just have to know.”

No one was listening even though they all could hear. Too busy looking at digital cameras and cell phones.

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

Then mumbling again as he approached the sporting goods section.

“Please. I love you. Amen.”

Once he had purchased the gun and the ammo, he hid his hands behind the open case as he keyed open the trigger lock. Then as quickly as he could he loaded two bullets into the magazine and the magazine into the pistol.

All the Wal-Mart Associate™ could manage was, “Um...?”

“I’m sorry,” and he raised a gun.

No time for a scream. The entire store, 100 associates and 300 customers—there was no way to know where the sound of that gunshot came from.

Then Mark turned the gun, the taste of cold metal.

He had the thought: Now I’ll finally know.
