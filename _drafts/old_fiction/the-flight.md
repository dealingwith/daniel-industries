The Flight -- Towards a story of Integration


I - Preface

The beer has made me lucid. So that is why I might ever share this story with you. I know that it will sound strange, even mystical at times. But if I am to share it with you, you must promise one thing: to listen. I do not want to speak of this lightly; I do not want the story to be heard, then forgotten. It must indwell itself in your mind, if only as a gray influence, a rudder to steer you forever onward.

I emphasize this because I believe that in every story there is a lesson, a lesson that remains with the person who hears for as long as they breathe. And for a listener, it is indeed only a gray rudder against a thick, dark blue sea. But for the one who experiences that story, it might just, with a piece of luck plucked from the body of fate, change the neural structure of their being so much that, in any given situation from that time forward, their experience and their actions would be irrevocably changed.

I feel a little looser; the thoughts are coming a bit more clearly. The tingling extends from my toes to my fingers to my ears to the top of the head. The events I intend to share with you are clearer in my mind and I feel like the timing just might be right. That perhaps you are more prone to believe me. My subconscious is closer to the surface; I may less opaquely communicate my intention and my story. 

I know we have only had a moment together, that we really don’t know each other well. Possibly that is why I choose you to hear this tale. Because you will judge me, it is made less damaging in the fact that I may never see you again. It is less like meticulously building a model ship and pushing it hopefully into the lake than it is like simply throwing a feather into the air for the wind to take where it may. 

II - By Way of Introduction

For me it starts long ago, with a promise to never be a middle-class has-been. Never sell out to the corporate system. Never strive against impossible and completely arbitrary odds. Maintain a peace with myself and my dreams and my hopes and my personalities. Yes, it is true: even I have multiple personalities. There is the one that I love, who treats everyone right, says all the right words, and does all the right things. Then there is the rejected, dispossessed rock star in need of blind affection.

But all those promises have vaporized for me. And oddly, I’ve become very content. I think it has been love. Love causes my contentment. It causes everything for me, and as far as motivations go, I deem love pretty high up there. I am where I am right now because of love, my love, my love for one particular person, one particular person of the opposite sex; my wife. 

So for me the hopes, dreams, even personalities must be crucified for the sake of love. Strangely modeling my chosen God, save for the horrible way that I have gone about it, complaining and miserable as I have been. Save these precious moments of clarity. Otherwise, however, I have often made a terrible mess of it, damaging my soul and the souls of those I absolutely cherish. I wonder sometimes if God is just shaking his head, laughing, crying, proud, or ashamed?

Mostly, though, I’ve wondered where God’s gone. Before my love showed up and cluttered up my life entirely, it was like he was always there in front of me, beside me, or at least behind me. Now I wonder if his entire job was to show me my love. I wonder if his light will ever shine so brightly before my eyes as hers does…but now I’m getting ahead of myself.

Here I sit, a victim of beautiful and ecstatic love, enjoying my tortuous fate more than anyone has ever received pleasure from such a crime; such a crime of passion. 

My story must begin with some understanding of travel. I am commonly finding myself getting on a plane. In fact, here I am again: another week of in and out of one place and into the next; from one geography to another; from one weather system to another. Rotely performing my spell on groups of two, three, tens, doing my show to entertain their greedy minds and fulfill my duty to the almighty – the company. 

There is no other place in the world like an airport. I don’t care if you are in JFK or in Jasper International. It doesn’t matter if you are in LAX or London-Heathrow, Tel-Aviv or Hong Kong. There is just no place like the airport. Many times I have wondered how some such people always end up in airports. People whom you would never see in real life show up at the airport to take part with you in this ridiculous ritual of purgatory. But then, they are probably here for pleasure, of their own will, going somewhere with meaning. It is for pleasure only that travel can be at all tolerable. For the expected reward of a culturally hedonistic experience with my love is the only way that I can bear this with any humor whatsoever. 

As I was saying – airports: what an interesting conglomeration of peoples, lifestyles, cultures, smells, dirts, warts, bodily fluids, terrible perfumes, cigarettes, beer, orange juice, bottled water, coffee you could scour a stainless sink with, magazine stands pilfering your attention and sometimes your currency for information or opinions that will last for the thirty seconds that you read of them, terrible chairs, phones that have been on everyone’s ear and mouth, computer bags…

Oh, yes, the computer bags. It seems that there is an indefinite amount of individuals also stuck in my shoes, doing the same in and out and on to the next place; except they don’t see it as such. They see it as exciting. They see it as a success story. They see their existence as meaningful and upright and otherwise very highbrow. It’s all in the computer, you see. 

“How you like the IBM?”

“It’s not mine. It’s my company’s.”

“Oh, yeah? I have a Dell. I like it. I’ve looked at those IBM’s, though. ThinkPad, right? What model is that?”

“Uhhh….” I look. “600E.”

“So you like it, huh?”

“I guess so. I can’t really say. I’ve never had anything else.”

I think sometimes of some sick conglomerate of the icons of the last three decades, of a man sporting a butterfly collar and large gold medallions which dangle in front of his shaved, tanning-booth chest, sniffing coke off of the LCD of his laptop…cell phone ringing from his waist.

Then there are the friends who also, somehow, think that this think piece of fragile equipment under my hands is some kind of indication of my arrival, want the same, and ask my opinion about what kind to get. Don’t they know that I don’t know, that I wouldn’t be doing this if it weren’t for fate and love? How else could anyone do this? That’s the question I’ve wondered as I file through the airport gates, avoiding the cattle guards, trying not to be shit upon by the big spotted dairy cow in front of me. 

So the airports are one thing. However they are immeasurably more bearable than what I’m about to describe to you. This is because after enjoying the heavenly room and air of the port, you are then led onto the ship. It might as well be the slaughterhouse that our less fortunate models are led to. This is the living slaughterhouse. No guillotine at the end of the journey. That is the only difference. No, there is a guillotine. It chops off your dignity. 

I’m always trying to avoid this inevitable experience for as long as possible. Those people I told you about, the interestingly odd ones you see herding along the broad alleyways of the port--once on the ship they become cannibals. There are several amazing phenomena of human behavior at work on these vessels. I must share some in order to bring the needed context to my story.

The first is that psychologically, it is somehow infinitely better to damage your own belongings than it is to potentially allow someone else to damage your belongings. There are two types of people bringing humongous bags onto the plane. The first ones are those I’ve already spoken of, with the computers, the ones with the attitudes, the status symbol comparing and the cute polo shirts with embroidered three-color corporate logos over the left pocket. Their fundamental motivation is to avoid the final cattle stall, the baggage claim. The other is the sworn enemy of the first. These over-sized human beings have equally over-sized personalities and amazingly, the bags to match their girth and aura. After using their possessions to deliver a quick and subtle kidney punch to their adversaries, these people then proceed to sacrifice their own belongings in an attempt to squander any attempt to keep anything intact or, at the very least, un-adulterated by co-existing bags. 

So I sit, in the middle of this ongoing war. I never try to make peace – that would be futile and foolish. I just observe. Someday perhaps I will use my knowledge and skills as a mercenary, selling my skills to the highest bidder. But for now I’m stuck in the middle, observing.

Now I’ve already explained to you the status group, as I will call them. But this second group, the girth group, as I will call them, they are an even more amazing enigma. Have you ever seen those movies where the antagonist exists solely to annoy the crap out of the protagonist, to the complete ignorance of the supporting cast? I can only suspect that this group I attempt to describe here falls somewhere in between that amazingly annoying, yet harmless Bob movie, and the completely deliberate malice of Pacific Heights. However it is their seeming ignorance to their own terrible war that is so unbelievable. For this reason we must endure them. It is that old joke about the act that takes the least intelligence to accomplish is what reproduces the species. Does that support or disprove evolutionary theory?

Once seated in your own custom-made torture devise, the real fun starts. Inevitably, I end up next to the latter group’s president and top performer. This is the second phenomena…what I will call the Space Phenomena. This is what forces you to exist in a space that you, up until this point in time, never thought it possible to exist within. Personal space quickly becomes a joke as the collective group becomes quickly, yet convincingly, anesthetized to their situation. It is as if these no-more-polite-than-the-rest-of-us people in the skirts and the horribly ugly scarves have this hypnotic effect on us, changing us from individualistic, free-thinking peoples into a mass of oozing mud-spring muck. Up until now, we were at least individual cows, led by a series of fences, to our ultimate fate: this primal, smelly blob of semi-organic cells. 

The Space Phenomena is where the girth group excels. It is only natural, no? They manage to steal every piece of dignity-preserving personal space you ever promised yourself you would never allow to be stolen. Touching skin with a complete stranger is no problem for these people. Many times I have wondered if they even own nerve endings in their arms. You know how you can squeeze your elbow as hard as you want and you won’t feel it? Maybe their entire arm is like that. And there is no sense in trying to steal that space back. Once it is in their grasp it is gone for good. All you can do is retreat until they have the territory they demand. 

Thus you must remain, jealous of the space and comfort that your luggage is enjoying down below, thinking that you’d trade a little pressurization for just two more centimeters. 

There are other phenomena worth mentioning, while I am at it. For example, the gas situation. I’m not talking about other people’s gas; if that were the only problem a simple and non-discreet finger to the nose blocks most of the offensive odor. No, I speak of one’s own gas, the kind that feels like it will bubble back on through the other end if you push it back one more time. With letting it go, it is always a risk. There are those absolutely odorless ones, a indescribable and unbelievable redemption when one has escaped in such a socially unacceptable location. These are rare, however, so for the most part you are forced to endure the pushing back process, a strange flexing of the muscles that feels like a large squirm, though you try to convince yourself that no one could or would notice.

You could try to get up and go to the broom closet in order to relieve yourself of your offensive and uncomforting companion. The broom closet, referred to as a lavatory on most commercial flights, is a room designed by a 3’4” individual with the suction-powered hole and the reverse sink drain plug. Also, if you are ever lucky enough to fly business or first class, there is a flower in there. A fake one. But more on that later. 

Yes, you could try to get up and get to the closet in time, but what always happens? The need disappears as soon as you stand up. You go there, stand around for a few laborious minutes, nothing happens, and you’re forced to go back to your seat or suffer quick and painful claustrophobia onset. Few people know, by the way, that claust actually means closet in ancient welsh dialects, and that’s why it’s called that.
 
Worse yet is when it is not gas, but solids! What does one do then with one’s fecal necessities? How long is this flight? Can I make it? God, please may I make it? What if one is sick? What does one do then? This is when travel become a true and undeniable nightmare. Have you ever attempted this procedure? Sure, we’ve all gone number one into the closet suction devise, that’s different. But what does that suction devise do with solids? Did you ever ask yourself that? 

Well, I’ll tell you what it does: it’s like a terrible, shit-eating monster that chews it’s prey before slowly and disgustingly swallowing it. The worst part is that you must control this monster. You must stand there and push it’s ear down, so that it chews and chews and finally swallows, all while you are forced to stand there, bent over (if you’re over 3’4”), watching the horrible display. It’s enough to make one entirely sick.

There are other, less revolting phenomena at work in such an aircraft. There are times when, Lord permitting, there are not personal space annexers to either side of you. This then allows the thought to enter one’s head, “Perhaps this is a normal human individual who might, on some level, be interesting to engage.” But then the problem, how does one engage a complete stranger who is sitting only a few dangerous centimeters from one’s own personal space? The person is in a demilitarized zone: they haven’t yet invaded, but you can’t be sure they’re not ready to pounce at any second, and you must keep your guard up; and one can never engage in friendlies when one has one’s guard up.

When the person is actually attractive in appearance on some level, this increases the tension. Now there is a greater than average perceived interest potential in engaging this person. This is when you might, possibly, perceivably, no, inconceivably want to get to know this person. Be it their physical appearance, or something they said to the stewardess that made you laugh, or just their aura--this person might be an experience. Mostly, it’s the aura. What makes people’s aura more or less attractive? Personally, I’ve found foreign auras more attractive than American ones, but then that could be me; however I do believe that a true red-blooded American upbringing damages the aura, I just don’t want to have to argue the point because it’s just a feeling, a hunch, anyway.

More importantly, what makes it so hard to interact with someone who, in particular, has a very powerful aura? Intimidation? Fate? Personality (is my aura that weak?)? Or just the opposite--is my aura like a strong pole, butting up against another? Or in fact is it that that pole is the opposite pole, and the strong inherent and subversive pull you feel towards that person is in fact terrifying the living Christ out of you? If it didn’t scare you so, what would happen? How would it feel? Would it be ok? Would it be disaster? Is it in fact the devil in disguise, drawing you with the temptation of a higher calling and a higher sense of being? Or is the fear that in itself?

There I go again, not making any sense. Please forgive me. I know not what I do. 

Well, this is the situation into which I am thrust. Oh please forgive me again. Not the part about being near a strong aura. Although that has happened plenty and maybe I’ll tell you about that someday. Whenever I figure it out for myself. But I mean the airplane. The travel, the horribly, barely bearable part of my existence felt out in crowded airports and stuffy airplanes, breathing recycled air full of happily traveling toxins and diseases, sitting in places ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort, drinking drinks made for sinners, a purgatory from which there will be no conceivable end.

III - The beginning

My story starts in a comfortable haze. I’m in the waiting area. I sit there before the butchering funnel, where the cattle hurry in, not knowing their fate. We all sit, with plain, dejected looks on our faces. Some are at peace, some not, some laugh, some dream. Some are dreamers.

I sit and look at the faces that surround me, wondering what makes such a diversity. Is that the redeeming quality of this venture? No, I’m sorry; there is no redeeming quality of this atrocity. 

I see many faces. Faces of hope, of despair, of frustration, of love. I wonder what lives make up these faces; what life lights these eyes. What persons breathe into these souls; what being take their breathe away. We all live terrible lives, but I wonder what makes them so amazing? Each life sitting here, no matter how pathetic they look to me right now, is amazing in some way. I see the people getting off the plane, being greeted by people they love, and wonder what creates this wall between us all, here in the staging area to hell. Here in purgatory only those lives most touched by love can connect.

And then the thought hits me: what if we all die today? What would be lost? What lovers would cry? Who would die inside if we all perished on the outside? What jobs would need to be replaced? What volunteer positions would have to be filled? What church pews would be cold? What sound waves would spin off into the universe instead of hitting an eardrum, stimulating an auditory nerve, firing synapses, causing thoughts that alter the divine tilt of the universe? What light waves would go the same course?

Would the balance have to be cut in the birthing centers, hospitals and bedroom floors of this vast world? Would that be the end for one light, simply making room for another? Or would we survive in some way, if not physical? What would we all be in another life, or in an extension of our current situations? What if life really just shifted, if all our ancestors are really all just two inches to our right, shuffling around where we can’t see them and they can’t see us? What if this life really had some determinant on that one? That would be terrible. Surely that can’t be the case, at least not all the time. But how can we be sure? I hear people say they are sure that they are sure all the time. But are they sure or have they just convinced themselves that honesty with the situation, that is, that they have no idea what the fuck is going to happen and never could until it does, is simply not the best course of action for their delicate hearts?

Suicide

What about those that can’t wait? Those that must propel themselves into the never again, the great beyond, with a willful abandon normally left for those with no brain; in this case, I guess it is those with no will. 

But really, anyone who hasn’t seriously considered suicide has simply just not fully considered the reality of his or her current situation. If one thinks long enough about where they are in the scheme of things, that is things in the sense of what the hell we are doing amongst all these people, all these living beings, all these created things, all these quiet creatures of the soil, all this air floating about us, all these waves traveling around and through us, all that space and all those planets and all that great unknown, all those possible alternatives that exist right beside yet fully apart from us…then they can fully recognize the reality of their life. That it is of no consequence and they should donate their organs before they expire from some more natural or careful means.

So what keeps so many of us from doing ourselves in and forgetting about the day-to-day torment? What allows some to stop fighting it? I wish I knew either, on alternate days.

It’s not all about fun. It’s not all about meaning, either.

Brew

There are two things which can inspire a muse quicker than a cow pie can attract a fly:

There is that which is brewed of beans and inspires a quickening in the synaptical occurrences of one’s personal thought devise, particularly in early or late hours of the day. Coffee. Sometimes it can backfire on you; it is really the world-wide test of perfectly controlled moderation: without it, worthless, with too much, worthless; but in some particular range specific to your personal being, it can heighten said synaptic events, increasing what we on this dismal planet have associated with success and happiness.

The other would be that which is brewed of grain and is causing me to even tell you this whole story in the first place, and take all fucking night with it, at that. This one is second and most ruined test of moderation in the world. The grade curve on this test looks like a profile of a triple black slope somewhere in Colorado--starts real high and goes straight down immediately. Lots of failures; and it’s pass or fail, really. For example, right now I would pass by the skin of my teeth; but it at this point precisely where the little voice inside your ear canal tells you that you can go ahead and blow this one. You’ll study up for the next one and pass IT with flying colors; but not this one. You’re going to take the ‘F’ on this one. 

But right now I’m still passing; and if you’re passing, then the muse might come.

With both of these drinks it is interesting to note that they inspire communion. Rarely do you hear, “Let’s go grab a cup of water,” or “Let’s go out for a couple of orange juices.” Sometimes you do, but it’s just not as common. 

Oh I just had déjà vu again. That’s weird.

At any rate, these people, they all congregate around these terrible liquids, whose main purpose is to deliver drugs to the bloodstream, and they talk. They talk with much more than their lips and tongues, too. It starts with the pull up. Do they swing right into the parking space or back in? Or did they appear right out of nowhere? Or did they skate up? What’s the vehicle? Pricey or thrifty, and is it trendy-pricey or functional-pricey? Then there’s the disembark. The first impression on the real world. What is this person getting out of this transport going to be like? Male or female? Fat or thin? Fashionable or making their own fashion? Walking with ease or dragging their personality ten feet behind? Comfortable out in the atmosphere or wishing for the musty car scent again already?

Then there’s the order. This obviously will depend on which brew you’re going for, but from within each there is a pecking-orderish communication going on beneath the simple act of placing your request. It’s the human equivalent of monkeys chirping or goats butting heads. It’s just a simple, “Hey, this is me, the one with that car and that walk, who is about to order…” And then it comes.

Ok, first off, in either brew house, you could go for the transcendent pick: the tea, the wine, the juice, the cognac.

Love

When in matters of love, remember that it must be like justice. Love, like that old lady in front of courthouses across this country, is a scale. On one side, the heart, in the other, the mind; and the demon straddling the top of the scale like an obnoxious jester is the accumulation of many a chemical, natural or otherwise, that guide us, sickeningly, through our days. 

It is dreadfully easy, enjoyable, terrible and dangerous to stick one’s organ into or overtop of too many places it shouldn’t be. It is also, to even greater extents, the same effect to stick one’s heart in too many places where it doesn’t belong. The problem is, of course, not missing any of the life that awaits when one puts their heart in exactly the right place and in exactly the right portion.


Learning

It’s interesting that we as a society are so hung up on looks and, really, performance, on ego and our own perception of our identity, that the Starbucks barista can’t even admit with a straight face when they’ve made a mistake, and we can’t even inform them of it without an attitude. Where normal people are turned into contorting medusas of stink and glare.

Music

What is it about music that moves us? What is it about rhythm, melody and harmony that makes our soul jump and our heart alternately skip beats, and pump in steady thumps? What is it that can move us to tears or rage, deepest sympathies or distain, perfection or comfort, warmth or discomfort, peace or war, love or hate? It makes our bodies move, our minds open to the impossible realities of the un-reality: spirituality, heaven, hell, the earth, consciousness (on its own or the collective one). It drives us to pour out our hard-earned bargaining chips, bequeathed in cold hard cash, or when necessary, in debt to one of the controlling financial institutions of our choice. It is of no consequence. This is music.

There are as many styles as there are people. I swear. Nothing amazes or intrigues me more than walking the stacks at a great record store. I could spend hours there. All the different genres, all the different artists. There are so many musicians and poets searching for our ears, hoping we will listen, connect, hear their cry. It’s utterly overwhelming. In this day of the world economics and global reach, the amount of variety of truly great, moving work at our fingertips is astonishing.

Yet it is funny how after you haven’t heard a song for years and years, and you hear that pitiful nostalgia in your ears once again, it is truly a time machine. Smells you haven’t known for life epochs come back to your nostrils, feelings fill your heart that you didn’t know you could feel anymore; you can be a kid again, a young professional again, a middle-aged success again, a free and lonely empty nester again; you can have any part of your history back again, instantly. Music truly is a soundtrack and a timeline for our lives.

Music also can accelerate or slow certain portions of our lives, in positive and (seemingly) negative ways: a sad time in life can be sympathized and extended, both, by the right melancholy tunes; a period of high energy and exhilarating experience can be sped to insane speeds with the right recording. The opposite is true for both; music could also keep us in homogeneity. In any case, it burns the experience of life more deeply into the wood of our days.

I say all these things in question. What the hell is it about music? I wish I knew. I know there are people thinking and studying the same. All I know is I thank god for these ears to hear. 

I want to hear that infinite possibility. For there is magic; there is mystery; there is God incarnate in the wave. God in the energy of sound, reverberating that precious alter in the side of my head.

Sexuality

What if there really isn’t really heterosexual and homosexual? What if we’re all just varying degrees of androgyny? Those we might consider gay are really just
