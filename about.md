The [blog](/blog) started in 2001 and now has over 3,000 posts. Posts are single links/thoughts, collections of links, journals, or longer posts about philosophy, bicycling, music, or the internet. It started as a notebook, became a micro-blog, then a proper blog (long after blogging had peaked). I like to think of it as a public [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), although that feels aspirational. There is ample cringe and broken links in the old stuff, which I am slowly editing over the course of years.
