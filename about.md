### Product-focused technology leader

{% include_relative about_content.md %}

The [blog](/blog) started in 2001 and now has over 3,000 posts. Some are single links or thoughts, or collections of links, or journals of moments in my life, or longer posts about philosophy, bicycling, music, or the internet. There's not at present a coherent way to navigate specific types of content, and I consider that a feature, not a bug.

See also: [uses](/uses) and [now](/now).

I sometimes post to [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@dealingwith). I have some words and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dealingwith).
