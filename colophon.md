This site is built using the [Jekyll Ruby-based static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) and has been for the last decade or so. Prior to that, many Content Management Systems were used, including a home-spun PHP-based CMS called [SWIM](/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/). It started its life in 2001 on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/).

I have removed any font style specifics except for post titles and _sans-serif_ for body text. If you don't like the font, change your browser default for sans. I do set _font-size_ to `1.05rem` and _line-height_ to `1.5rem` based on my own preferences for reading.

It is built on my personal computer, a Dell XPS laptop running PopOS.

It is written in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I typically use a theme from [Catppucin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) or [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu). [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is used to manipulate images, when necessary. It is deployed via rsync from the terminal. I use Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), with the [Oh My Zsh git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) getting heavy use. Source code is managed via git and GitHub. The font used in both VSCode and the terminal is [Intel One Mono](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono). It used to be [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig).

Post ideas are stored and managed in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/ "Logseq: A privacy-first, open-source knowledge base").
