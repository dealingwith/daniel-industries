### Artists

In 2004 I initiated the opening of a local art gallery in Dallas, TX. (I had just moved to the city.) I did not run it but participated in its operations and subsidized it by living in the back of the space. It lasted one year, made financially impracticable when I needed to move. In that year, and in the years that followed, I met many visual artists and became friends with some of those. I bought more art than I ever had up to that point (and since). My point is, buy local art. You won't regret it. Don't buy prints or copies of famous artworks. Save up for a piece by someone you can connect to in real life.
