<small><i>here's what I'm up to right now (last updated on 08/23/2022)</i></small>

I'm still in Dallas. I landed for a quick life break in 2004 and have been stuck here ever since despite the horrid Texas politics and unbearably hot summers. Raising children, preventing the house from collapsing, running a software development team. [Riding my bicycle](https://www.strava.com/athletes/199489) a fair amount, mostly for mental health reasons. Writing not _nearly_ as much as I would like. Blogging on occasion. Teaching people how to code, usually through gaming but also just by showing them how creative an act coding is. Reading as much as I can. Coding up personal productivity automations. Scheming some new web app ideas.
