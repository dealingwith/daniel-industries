    <p>Ezra Caldwell* posted an intimate and important** post that I want to both capture for my future reference and share with you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sitting there on the water I began to talk myself into a state of utter self loathing‚Ä¶An hour later, though, I found myself in a little sleeping cabin apart from the house, curled up in the fetal position completely catatonic. My mind was racing, and none of it good. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how, for instance, how I was going to be able to get back to NYC. (‚ÄúDrive the rental car, you fool!‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt possibly! I might drive it off the road and kill my wife in a state of self distructive insanity!‚Äù)‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From somewhere far back in my head, I watched myself go crazy.  There was a part of me in there that found the whole thing fascinating.  A part of me that was saying, ‚ÄúOk Ezra‚Ä¶snap out of it. This is nonsense.‚Äù Intellectually I was able to recognize that what was going on was madness and yet I couldn‚Äôt stop the waves of very real emotions that were overwhelming me.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had lost <em>all</em> confidence. The swagger and cockiness that held me together for the last 3 years simply vanished. I guess I had been waiting for that to happen‚Ä¶I was forced to recognize that without the arrogance, the thing that I really hate about myself, I simply fell apart. (I realize now, that I have about three years of justifiable falling apart to catch up on!)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hill had been napping inside, and came out to find me. I couldn‚Äòt even speak. I managed finally to say, ‚ÄúBaby‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in serious trouble.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Special Ed brought a bottle of bourbon out and helped me talk my way back to earth. I went inside and cooked dinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>My friend and producer Salim Nourallah has a new record coming out this summer. Be on the lookout for it. This tune crossed my desk about the same time as Ezra‚Äôs post and seemed to just fit. Had a stressful day today, but it‚Äôs odd how not-really-stressful ‚Äúnormal‚Äù stress is to me now. Intellectually I know that circumstances are stressful, I even see it written across my friends‚Äô faces‚Ä¶but my heart is less troubled. The scale <a href="/2011/02/28/I-can-not-go-on/">has been re-calibrated after all</a>.</p>

<p class="postscript">* Who you <a href="/2010/10/24/fast-boy/">will remember from previous posts</a>.<br /><br />** &hellip;at least for those who have also experienced traumatic times in their lives; it ties into a lot of things about fear that I have been thinking about lately; about how to deal with the realities of the future given the horrors of the past; about <a href="/2011/02/06/a-black-wave-is-comin/">coping</a> with whatever that traumatic experience did to one's psychology.</p>
