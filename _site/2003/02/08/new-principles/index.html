    <p>A while back I was back in Pennsylvania having a discussion about values, politics, whether I was a pacifist, and most importantly principles.</p>

<s><em>Ed. note</em>--I have hidden most all of this entry. I am still hashing it out. Check back later. For now enjoy these lyrics:</s>

<p>First on the pacifist question: first go to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/faithmaps/">faithmaps</a> group and <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/faithmaps/messagesearch/15791?query=pacifist%20pacifism">start doing a search for pacifism</a> for some really good info/discussion of the topic.</p>

<p>The main point of the pacifism discussion in PA was the <em>classic</em> question “someone has a gun to your wife’s head and you have a gun, do you shoot?” I answered those months ago with “yeah” and of course I was no longer a pacifist. But I’ve thought really quite too much about the question since then and I’ve realized, even more than I did realize it then, that that question is the most fucked up thing in the world. My answer, by the way, is No. I would not shoot the guy about to shoot Miriam. Why? Because 1) I would refuse to believe that he/she were really going to shoot the person I love with my life. That is an impossible human situation that I know people have been in, albeit not many people, and the impossibility of the situation makes it an impossible question that anyone with any intellectual rigor would not pursue in a rhetorical fashion (it is a great question for those supporting war or just war or gun rights, they just go “hell yeah i’d blow the fucker’s head off!” no problem) and 2) I wouldn’t have the balls to pull the trigger. I cannot imagine killing someone intentionally (or not for that matter), no matter the circumstances (one ludicrous exception forthcoming). Even if I did then witness the impossibly tragic event presented (someone murdering my soulmate…thanks again to this rhetorical question for allowing my mind to think about that impossible situation), and still have the gun in my hands (by the way how the hell does a pacifist walk around with a gun in his hands anyway? more on this in a sec), I still wouldn’t get my revenge, or inact instant justice on this person. What good would it do? They have already taken away everything about my life worth living. There can be no justice for me in this life. They can go on living, I can, we both can, we both could not, it does not matter.</p>

<p>Now you’re thinking I’ve already thought about this issue too much? HA! How about this:</p>

<p>There is ONE situation where I would shoot (again, chances of me having a gun?), and that would be if someone were raping her. (Again, these are horrible and morbid and impossible thoughts, feel free to take a break but if this is an issue you’ve thought a little about maybe my overthinking about it will help with your own beliefs.) Now, I wouldn’t shoot right away. More likely I would physically attack the demonic person and try to otherwise neutralize their ability to do harm in some less (but still obviously) violent way. SO that leaves ONE situation where I can think of pulling the trigger (on the, once again, impossibly obtained weapon), that would be where they have the wherewithall to both abuse the victim and hold me at gunpoint (theoretically a standoff, I guess, if I am also pointing a weapon of similar desctructive powers), where I have no other option if I were to stop the abuse. Because in my conscious, that is the one act of human treachery that trumps killing; and to protect that victim from further abuse, and if there were no other option to me, I would kill the perpetrator. (Just for clarification, I am in no way saying convicted rapists should be executed. I am against the death penalty entirely, even for the most heinous offenders. This has only to do with stopping an abuse that is in progress where I have no other option. If I walk in 1 sec after the rape we are back to square one. There would be no justice; killing the offender would be meaningless {IMHO} to the abused.) (Another aside: assuming this wasn’t during war, that there was rule of law, this would be manslaughter, right? Or self-defence since he pointed a gun at me?)</p>

<p>But now we get back to the ridiculousness of the hypothetical “proof” to begin with. I cannot conceive of firing a weapon at another human being except in one particular impossible situation which god willing <b>nobody</b> is ever put into. So why do I have a gun to begin with? Is this a war and: 1) I am a civilian victim roaming the streets, and I see a gun on the ground and pick it up for potential future protection? 2) A friend gave it to me and said, take this in case of…? …Because I sure as hell didn’t obtain it under any kind of normal circumstance and if this is a war I am probably 1) dead already or 2) a refugee, having fled …because being a pacifist I would be a poor draft pick, not firing my weapon ever and all (I guess I could be in the military media pool but then I have this other crazy principle about telling the truth), and I would also make a really bad resistance fighter (although I would take great pleasure in subverting evil agressors in nonviolent ways, <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2003_02_02_theyblinked_archive.html#88701163">hacking perhaps</a>?) for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Conclusion (this has become so long I thought I’d point it out): Last night we were again hanging out with Bosnians. Some things you should understand about Bosnians, most all of them have experienced things no human should have to experience. If you meet them in the USA, they were likely displaced during the war, and even though they may love this country and have adjusted fully and not care to return to Bosnia, the fact of the matter is if it were not for the war they would be perfectly happy, still living with all their family still intact and in the same place, that place being Bosnia. Refugees, no matter how it happened (meaning if they snuck out of a country on their own, like a lot of Bosnians, like <em>Miriam’s family don’t forget</em>, or if in a massive wave following a full-on attack), will carry that experience with them for the rest of their lives, whether they are able to return to their homeland or not.</p>

<p>Same for victims of seige; with which an entire city’s worth of people I will be living amongst come May.</p>

<p>Same for victims of war; with which an entire country’s worth of people I will be living amongst come May.</p>

<p>My new principles have nothing to do with man’s right to live independent of government or man’s “rights” (to, e.g., own a gun) or any of these kind of things free people can take the time to think about and discuss.</p>

<p>My new principles:</p>

<p>There is absolutely no just war.</p>

<p>Because there is absolutely no just war, there is other option for human conscious than pacifism. If you can justify one small act of violence, you can justify any type of war. If you can trick your heart into not torturing you over the murder of one person, you can trick it into suffocated silence over the rape and murder of thousands, even millions.</p>

<p><i>Murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3…</i></p>

<p>This has nothing to do with guilt or innocence. It has nothing to do with personal or national defence. It sure as hell has nothing to do with morality.</p>

<p>Morally, there is no just war.</p>

<p>Those who disagree talk to me when there is an army about to overrun the USA. I doubt I will change my mind. {It is a personal issue, and I would rather die justly than survive unjustly, even if I am the only one who thinks it to be so. This country has no idea what it means to make these decisions when your home and livelihood are actually at stake. This country has always been the agressor. We were attacked by an outside force once, 1812, and considering what we were doing to Africans and American Indians at the time, it doesn’t really count.}</p>

<p>Otherwise it is you who have the damaged moral compass, at least as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>Go ahead. Shoot. Me. Yeah, that’s right. That way I’ll find out who’s right first. You can stay alive down here…with your conscious to keep you company.</p>

<p><b>Murder By Numbers</b></p>

<p>by Sting and Andy Summers</p>

<p>performed by the Police</p>

<p><i>Once that you’ve decided on a killing</i></p>

<p>First you make a stone of your heart</p>

<p>And if you find that your hands are still willing</p>

<p>Then you can turn a murder into art</p>

<p>There really isn’t any need for bloodshed</p>

<p>You just do it with a little more finesse</p>

<p>If you can slip a tablet into someone’s coffee</p>

<p>Then it avoids an awful lot of mess</p>

<p>It’s murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your ABC</p>

<p>Murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your ABC</p>

<p>Now if you have a taste for this experience</p>

<p>And you’re flushed with your very first success</p>

<p>Then you must try a twosome or a threesome</p>

<p>And you’ll find your conscience bothers you much less</p>

<p>Because murder is like anything you take to</p>

<p>It’s a habit-forming need for more and more</p>

<p>You can bump off every member of your family</p>

<p>And anybody else you find a bore</p>

<p>Because it’s murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your ABC</p>

<p>Murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your ABC</p>

<p>Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious</p>

<p>In history’s great dark hall of fame</p>

<p>All our greatest killers were industrious</p>

<p>At least the ones that we all know by name</p>

<p>But you can reach the top of your profession</p>

<p>If you become the leader of the land</p>

<p>For murder is the sport of the elected</p>

<p>And you don’t need to lift a finger of your hand</p>

<p>Because it’s murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your ABC</p>

<p>Murder by numbers, one, two, three</p>

<p>It’s as easy to learn as your A, B, C, D, E
&lt;/i&gt;</p>
