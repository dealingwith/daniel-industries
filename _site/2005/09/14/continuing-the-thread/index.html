    <p>The part of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dealingwith/141853.html">that last rambling post</a> that I’ve been most stuck on has been
the total aside (“Like {…}”), where I use the term “financial independence”
to mean two different things, meaning what it means–never needing to work
again–but also just “not being dependent on others” or really just
“sustained.” But the reason I’m hung up on the aside is because the end-end
I’m really thinking about here is happiness. (Something <a href="http://www.erikbenson.com/">Benson</a> has done a
lot of thinking/writing/toolbuilding around.)</p>

<p>There’s a ton of research on this from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud">Freud</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;hs=hOu&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=scholart&amp;q=delayed+gratification+goal+achievement">on down</a>. (<a href="http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/research/workshops/behavioral/Gollwitzer.pdf">OMG exactly</a>.)* Besides the scholarly research yet to be parsed, I’m interested
in collecting layman’s tools for creating environments nurturing to our semi-
universal end-ends. (Aside: this kind of stuff is the reason I majored in
Psych in the first place, and I am somewhat surprising myself that I am
returning to this subject matter at this time. I have some ideas as to why,
which I may write on if I feel they are helpful in the broader discussion.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.workhappy.net/2005/09/interview_with_.html">Something</a> I saw yesterday was from Jason Fried, net-famous founder of 37
Signals.</p>

<p>_<strong>As a successful entrepreneur and businessman, you’ve got many important
demands on your time, yet you still manage to get stuff done. What’s your
secret to time management? What methods/tools do you employ to manage your
time well?</strong></p>

<p>I’m really not that great at time management. I forget to do a lot of things
(especially writing thank you notes which is a horrible thing to forget to
do). Backpack reminders have definitely helped, but I’m still not great at
remembering the little things. It’s something I need to get better at (and
that’s not a software thing, it’ a personal thing). Software doesn’t solve
problems unless you make the software solve problems. Software is dead unless
you breathe life into it.</p>

<p>The other thing is to make things easy on you. It’s a lot like our Less
Software approach – the less features and the less code, the less can go
wrong and the less you have to manage. It’s the same with time. Make things
easier on you – make quick, simple decisions and then go back and change that
decision if it doesn’t work. If you make a mistake it’s no big deal if you can
correct that mistake quickly. Don’t burden yourself with stuff that really
doesn’t matter. It’s a bit of an art to figure out what really doesn’t matter,
but it’s more than you probably think. Most things we all spend our time on
don’t really matter._</p>

<p>The interesting thing here is <em>he doesn’t answer the question</em> (although his
comment <em>Software doesn’t solve problems unless you make the software solve
problems</em> is very helpful to our discussion). He implies that knowing what
doesn’t “really matter” is an inherit skill, as is choosing what does “really
matter” over what doesn’t. But I would argue that this exceptionally soft
skill is exactly what seperates “successful” people from not. My question is,
what tools are there to facilitate and nurture this ability? <a href="http://www.franklincovey.com/">Covey</a> saw
wild success putting a point on some techniques for just that, but I’m more
interested in tools to fundamentally rewire the neurological events that
create such behavior-or-the-lack-thereof. What-the-bleep meets Covey, I guess.
Hmm…I’m already in academic territory. But, in the meantime, I’ll continue
to be on the lookout for layman’s tools, and thinking about low- and hi-tech
methodologies for nurturing “happy” “pre-ends.”</p>

<p>There’s a sick joke in there somewhere…</p>

<p>next: story as #1-primo tool!</p>

<p>*(Holding a strong goal intention (‘I intend to reach Z!’) does not guarantee
goal achievement because people may fail to deal effectively with self-regulatory problems
during goal pursuit. The present review analyzes whether realization of intentions is facilitated by
forming an implementation intention that spells out the when, where, and how of goal
pursuit in advance (‘If situation Y is encountered, then I will initiate goal-directed behavior X!’).
Findings from 94 independent tests showed that implementation intentions had a positive effect
of medium-to-large magnitude (d = .65) on rate of goal attainment. Implementation intentions
proved effective for selfregulatory problems having to do with initiating goal pursuit, shielding ongoing goal
pursuit from unwanted influences, disengaging from failing goals, and conserving capacity
for future goal striving. There was also strong support for postulated component processes;
implementation intention formation both enhanced the accessibility of specified opportunities
and automated respective goal-directed responses.)</p>
