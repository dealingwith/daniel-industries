    <blockquote>
  <p>“You’re not like born again or anything, are you?” she asked me earnestly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought for a moment. “Well, not really. It’s just beautiful, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s–I don’t know, it scares me,” she said gently, moving her knees
slightly back and forth in the bathwater, the ripples sending the soapy water
highup the sides of the thin plastic tub. She sat up, her breasts hanging
drenched and heavy on her chest. “That kind of language,” she continued
softly, “always makes me think that maybe in another lifetime I was burned at
the stake.” She splashed her face with water. “That stuff gives me the creeps.</p>

<p>“…Talking about God just seems so pointless.” There was a pause as she
figured out what she meant. “It’s like drilling a well right by a river, you
know? The water’s already there; you don’t have to dig for it. Whatever is
good or valuable about religion is always around us. You don’t have to go to
church for it. To be honest, churches give me the willies. Whenever I go
inside one, I feel like the whole place is pleading to some outside force, you
know? Like God or whatever is outside of us, withholding the goods. I don’t
really buy that idea–that someone up on a hill is doling out favors, but only
if we ask in a really really nice way. I don’t buy it, do you?”</p>

<p>…Amazing, I thought, how instantly I could feel I didn’t know Christy at
all, and how little I felt she knew me.</p>

<p>There is this place deep inside where I feel I am connected to everything, not
just trees and grass and dogs but buildings and stairways, rocks and
sidewalks. It’s a deathly quiet place that I guess I’ve never shared with
anyone and probably couldn’t, a place that is cold sober when my body is
stumbling drunk, another consciousness that sits still like an antenna in tune
with some other part of the galaxy. It was this part of me that I wanted to
bring to our wedding, a centered space from which I could send out my oaths. I
imagined that this secret antenna was my connection to whatever eternity might
be and was the part of me that Christy alone perceived and loved. But in the
dark of the motel room, I realized that whether I was married or not, no one
would ever know all of me; my truest self would always be estranged and alone.
I was incapable of expressing my limited screwball faith and I knew that, even
if I could, I’d box it in so dramatically it would be trivialized.</p>

<p>–from Ethan Hawke’s <em>Ash Wednesday</em></p>

<p>…originally posted on <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog">danielsjourney/blog</a>, August 6th, 2003. I decided
to read stuff from my time in Sarajevo tonight, and it turns out I have a lot
of stuff from that time, and it’s turned into an afternoon-long project, and
I’ve almost compiled a chapbook’s worth. This bit, not being my own, does not
go into the book, but as a passage of text, so perfectly relates to so much of
my life.</p>
