    <p>(Looks like it already has gone away‚Äìbut I‚Äôm unsure if it is temporary or
not.)</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/89a7292e5a9eee6d?hl=en">Poll: how many of you use /statuses/friends_timeline/user.format?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We‚Äôd still allow you to retrieve your friends_timeline for the
authenticating user, just not the authenticating user looking at another
user‚Äôs timeline. This latter method forces us to do a fairly complex query
that, when not cached, can be pretty painful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many of you actually make use of this method? Should it stay or should it
go? <strong>I can say that the equivalent view on the web is going away in all
likelihood.</strong> You‚Äôll still be able to see who another user follows, but not in
timeline format.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/al3x/statuses/819130952 (Of course it is possiblebecause of their own product!)">I so want to be a fly on the wall at TwitterHQ</a>. I‚Äôve <a href="http://dealingwith.livejournal.com/667936.html">vented</a> about
<a href="http://whentwitterisdown.com/">Twitter performance</a> before. Now they‚Äôre ripping out long-standing
functionality like crazy (hi paging! wait, aren‚Äôt you a basic feature of every
content-based site ever?), turning off IM for everyone* (supposedly over a
single errant API user, begging the question, why not just ban that
application until things are cleared up?), and getting really <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/twitter_refuses_to_uphold_terms_of_service#reply_503415">smarmy</a> when
<a href="http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/22/twitter-refuses-to-uphold-terms-of-service/">accused</a> of allowing abuse within their <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/our-terms.html (Twitter isn't acommunity, officially. They're more like the phone company. Except not. It'sconfusing. You wouldn't understand.)">community</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I haven‚Äôt enjoyed Twitter over IM for most of the year, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/im_not_geeting_any_tweets_via_im">apparently being an
edge case and not worthy of having my account looked at individually</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two things I will say about the whole thing, 1) it is an interesting
<a href="http://www.hueniverse.com/hueniverse/2008/03/on-scaling-a-mi.html (Istill have to read this entire thing, but it helps explain the original topicof this post)">topic from a technological perspective</a>, and 2) having multiple interfaces
‚Äìweb, (IM), SMS, API‚Äìeven when one goes down, there are usually options (SMS
seems pretty rock solid, and that was, admittedly, the original interface-of-
choice, right?). Each interface has a unique user experience‚Äìsince switching
to an API client I‚Äôve had to carefully adjust ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù (as opposed to
‚Äúnotifications‚Äù)*, since the API-based client gets my entire timeline. When I
step away from the computer, I only get ‚Äúnotified‚Äù (via SMS) on a much smaller
subset of people‚Äìmost of them local. The only issue is ‚Äútracking‚Äù‚Äìwhich only
works when I‚Äôm on SMS, which is the opposite of how I would prefer (and this
would be completely mitigated if IM worked for me). There is no API hook to
get messages based on tracked words, however. It is a feature only baked into
the messaging infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If Twitter is a communications utility (as they claim) and not social
software, then there should have never been this differentiation. All these
people <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=alex+albrecht+twitter">competing for followers</a> is incredibly lame, IMHO. But then
without the ability to follow without notifications, there would be less
social software wankers and spammers (granted, most of them don‚Äôt use it as a
communications utility, so in that sense it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference, they
would still be doing what they‚Äôre doing) and therefore less traffic, and
therefore less $$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will people begin to jump ship if Twitter continues to have downtime on the
scale* of this past week? I‚Äôm not so sure. I imagine the people who would bail
would be the very emotionally invested (all of us blogging about it), who have
no where to bail TO, or the opposite‚Äìthose who could care less either way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No pun intended, I promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest potential problem would be enough downtime that we get out of the
habit; after all, there was life before Twitter.</p>

<p>Would people pay for a stable Twitter? I think so. If Twitter could create a
scaling situation which favored paying users, or if someone came along with a
Twitter copy that didn‚Äôt fail, there might be some opportunity there.</p>
