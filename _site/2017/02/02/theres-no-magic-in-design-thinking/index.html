<blockquote>
  <p>when I asked them what they thought [design thinking] meant, their answer puzzled me. They told me it was a new approach to design, focusing on problem solving with multidisciplinary teams, producing competitive end-to-end solutions that delight customers, users, and employees.</p>

  <p><em>Problem solving? Multidisciplinary teams? End-to-end solutions? Delighting users?</em> I‚Äôd been researching and writing about integrating these elements for decades. What‚Äôs new here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve had the same problem. While I‚Äôm excited about the way design thinking has been injected into a lot of different domains, in my own domain of web product development I still considered this just <em>design</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, I‚Äôve needed to do what every seasoned design professional has found themselves doing: explaining why design is more than just making something pretty. When I‚Äôve worked with other designers, they get it.</p>

  <p>But once someone who isn‚Äôt a designer‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomeone who is a layperson‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis introduced into the mix, I‚Äôve found I need to convince them that design isn‚Äôt only about making the thing pretty. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs about solving problems. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs about end-to-end solutions.</p>

  <p>Some of the make-it-pretty meme comes from the way design is framed inside our society. TV shows, like Project Runway or This Old House, talk about design as the end stage, where the colors and decorations are added in. Go into a Home Depot or a Lowe‚Äôs and you‚Äôll find a section of the store called the Design Center, where they sell paint and decorative knickknacks to complete your rooms. There‚Äôs no discussion of problem solving or end-to-end solutions in that world of design.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs important to bring design into a project early, before the team settles on a solution, so they can truly explore the needs of the users. Yet, when we would propose this, we‚Äôd get these funny looks. Why should we care about the design that early? We haven‚Äôt even figured out what we‚Äôre doing yet? They‚Äôd always push back and tell us to come back later, when it was time for design to clean things up.</p>

  <p>That‚Äôs been the fight for decades. We‚Äôve spent so much time trying to get the laypeople to try to think about design in a bigger definition. Yet, they always come back to the notion that design is only about making it pretty.</p>

  <p><strong>Design Thinking is a Reframing of Design</strong></p>

  <p>The phrase design thinking changed all that. To a layperson, it was completely new. While it was made up of words they thought they knew, the combination was novel. ‚ÄúDesign thinking? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù</p>

  <p>Adding the word ‚Äòthinking‚Äô to ‚Äòdesign‚Äô was a brilliant move. David Kelley and Tim Brown, the founders of IDEO who popularized the term, were smart to take advantage of the unfamiliarity of the phrase.</p>

  <p>To those of us who‚Äôve been doing this for a long time, design thinking doesn‚Äôt mean anything new. But it also doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äòmake it pretty.‚Äô And that‚Äôs why it works.</p>
