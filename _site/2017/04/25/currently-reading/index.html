    <p>I‚Äôve recently started reading a bit more than I had been in the last few years‚Äìdue in no small part to having taken over kids‚Äô bedtime duty‚Äìand have focused on fiction for the first time in a long time. It‚Äôs refreshing and really helps my mind work better.</p>

<p>As always, however, I read at least a handful of books at the same time. This is less to do with attention span or any given book and more to do with the absurd amount of material I consider essential to consume given my various interests and the multitude of things asked of my expertise.</p>

<p>Recently finished:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Spell_for_Chameleon">A Spell for Chameleon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_of_Magic">The Source of Magic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Roogna">Castle Roogna</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_Aisle">Centaur Aisle</a>, the first four novels of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth">Xanth</a> series. I read a number of Xanth novels in junior and high school, but I can‚Äôt remember which anymore. I didn‚Äôt start at the beginning back then, that much I know, so starting there was nice. I eat these things up. They can be a little crude at times (in a Mad Men kind of way), but the plot speed, universe and vocabulary lessons are all great.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/2017/04/words.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837">Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business</a> (for work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886428-jagged-alliance-2">Jagged Alliance 2</a> by <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/">Darius Kazemi</a> (check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw">2014 XOXO Festival talk</a>). This book is great because it‚Äôs not just about a video game, it‚Äôs about the making of a video game.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Started but not planning to finish:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23317538-rising-strong">Rising Strong</a>. Seemed like good stuff, definitely some quotable bits, but it became a slog I can only describe with, ‚ÄúMeh.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Started but probably not going to finish:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.unreason.com/">Playing at the World</a> is a great history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a>. It is also very, very, very, very, very detailed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822857-make-something-up">Make Something Up: Stories You Can‚Äôt Unread</a> by Chuck Palahniuk. Historically I have been a huge Palahniuk fan. <em>Survivor</em> and <em>Invisible Monsters</em> are two of my favorite books. But in the last decade, I‚Äôve lost my taste for his particular brand of shock-horror. Still, there were a couple really good short stories in this collection. I just can‚Äôt recommend it because of the chances of triggering for anyone. I am now looking for the equivalent but for the middle-aged parent set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15575.The_Sword_of_Shannara?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Sword of Shannara</a>. I read this one in junior high as well. It is very long and a little tedious, but I am taking my time with it. No clue when I will get it done. My goal is to finish it before I dive back into the Xanth series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97905.The_No_Asshole_Rule?from_search=true">The No Asshole Rule</a>. Read the sample (chapter 1) from Amazon and then got it from the library. So far, it‚Äôs good. Need to get back into it before it‚Äôs due!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Sprint</a>. About the practice of design sprints. I‚Äôm fairly familiar with the content of this book, but it‚Äôs good to get it all in an organized and edited format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Inspired</a>. About software product design and development. We‚Äôre adopting most of the recommendations from this book at work. I‚Äôm again familiar with the content but not <em>as</em> familiar as I am with <em>Sprint</em>. I am a big fan of the author‚Äôs many talks on the same subject. Obviously, the book goes into a lot more detail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781941222379.do">The Nature of Software Development</a>. Kind of what it says on the tin. If I had this in digital instead of hard copy I would be done with it already, as it is a short one. Alas, I do most of my reading in the dark!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Queued:</p>

<p>The queue is impossibly long, but here are a couple in there that I have my eye on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25248845-the-letters-of-ivor-punch">The Letters of Ivor Punch</a>. I‚Äôve been a fan of Colin MacIntyre‚Äôs music (aka Mull Historical Society) for a long time. When I found out he‚Äôd written a novel I immediately picked it up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comic_book)">Saga</a>. I devoured the first two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_paperback_(comics)">trades</a> when they first came out and have three and four waiting in the wings. I think there are quite a few more than four at this point.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I just looked again at the queue and not only is it very long, it is full of amazing things I really want to read. Sometimes I think that if I were independently wealthy, I would just read all the time‚Ä¶(that‚Äôs not true)‚Ä¶</p>
