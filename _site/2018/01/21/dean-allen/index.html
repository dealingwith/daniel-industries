    <p><a href="https://om.co/2018/01/18/dean-allen-rest-in-peace/">Dean Allen, R.I.P.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dean Cameron Allen, a 50-ish writer, designer, web-guy, and an all-around rascal, died this weekend in London, U.K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not know Dean Allen, unlike most of the people who have <a href="https://kottke.org/18/01/rest-in-peace-dean-allen">blogged</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen">about</a> his life and death, but of course, I knew of him. He was that rare polymath, a brilliant writer and a brilliant technologist both. I wanted to be him. He developed a <em>popular</em> CMS (as opposed to my flop); wrote a popular, letter-perfect blog; lived in Europe; knew important Internet People.</p>

<p>And then he disappeared from the web.</p>

<p>I was looking at his Flickr‚Äìone of the few places that still hold any of his content‚Äìand was struck by this photo:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deanallen/2816808081/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3080/2816808081_a6ed0a7af1_z.jpg?zz&#x3D;1" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I find it interesting how such a simple photo can say so much about a person, a time, a place. The room. The computers. The server log on the laptop and zoomed-in text‚Äìthe font, no doubt, being meticulously chosen‚Äìon the Mac. Again, that polymathic mind at work. The black iPod. The ashtray. The espresso cup. The guitar case in the corner.</p>

<p>It feels, looking at that photo and remembering the man, that these are the kinds of artifacts we should leave behind. The posed family portraits are great, but it‚Äôs the minutia in the everyday that really tells the story.</p>

<hr />

<p>I‚Äôve deleted all my accounts on such sites; I have a hard drive littered with old photos, many of which evoke times I do not wish to recall. But‚Ä¶</p>

<p>One time, long ago, I started a small art project called <em>Progress</em> in which I took a photo of my desk and a screenshot of my computer every day for a while. It wasn‚Äôt compelling enough to do anything with. But I just dug up the images out of curiosity.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2018/01/8ii.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess I‚Äôve always had a messy desk. This was 2002. There was less internet back then, though. Printing was a thing. Books were still read on paper. CDs were a thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the moment it can feel like one is living anything but an authentic life. But in hindsight, the past can feel like a truly authentic time. Some of Dean Allen‚Äôs peers went on to great riches and internet fame, but everyone lived their present authentic experience, and hopefully will continue to do so until their inevitable end. Dean just reached his first.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the other side of having deleted all my social accounts, I often wonder what others think‚Äìif they think at all‚Äìabout what is going on in my life. (I assume most people who followed me on Twitter or were ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with me on Facebook do not even know about this blog.) Just like every once and a while I would remember Dean‚Äìusually through a project he had been associated with‚Äìand tried to see if he had re-appeared on the web anywhere.</p>

<p>I similarly sometimes think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why</a>, and wonder what he‚Äôs up to, and hope he‚Äôs doing well. It‚Äôs hard to remember these days that a life not lived in public is still an authentic, memorable life. Probably more so than its Instagrammed counterpart.</p>
