    <p>(repost, now with more video)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#sxswupdates">Updates</a></strong></p>

<p>SXSW inspired a lot of cognitive dissonance. I’m not even sure I can get it
all out into words. It’s clear in my brain. I don’t have a lot of time for
really cohesive blogging anymore, but I’ll try.</p>

<p>Part of that dissonance might be related to that last thing. There were a
<em>lot</em> people at SXSW with <em>plenty</em> of time to <em>blog</em> about a <em>lot</em> of things
and have <em>very important</em> thoughts. And by “very important” I mean asinine and
pathetic. [That combined with a huge emphasis on panels and “core
conversations” inspired a lot of hate][2].</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/armiller/3362592775/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3362592775_9e2ec81c1b_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>At the same time, I was again <em>really</em> inspired by SXSW this year.
If there was one overriding theme to the entire event, it was this: <strong>Things
suck, but you’re awesome</strong>. Most presentations (and yes I tried to stick to
the proper presentations) ended with some variant of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=your+awesome+who%27s&amp;btnG=Search+Images">this</a> (and <a href="http://twitter.com/KathySierra (god bless her, I have no idea why shepicked those colors for her Twitter page. to drive away stalkers, perhaps?)">Kathy
Sierra</a>’s really did).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/3354053054/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3471/3354053054_025d2eddee_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>Saturday I mostly played in the Lego pit and hit up <a href="http://twitter.com/barcampaustin">BarCamp</a>,
but I did make it to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/co8n43">Designing the Future of The New York Times</a>, which I
went to, of course, because of the brilliant <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Khoi Vinh</a>, but found myself
far more impressed with his colleague <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bodkin">Tom Bodkin</a> (<a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=bio&amp;id=196207">here’s his bio w/ pic
on the SX site</a>). His years of experience in a much richer design process
and culture spoke rather profoundly, I thought, to a room full of mostly
design hacks (myself, of course, included).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/steventrotter/3358353079/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3457/3358353079_d0a817851c_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>My first two panels talks on Sunday were <em>excellent</em>. First was
<a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0900124">Being a UX Team of One</a> by <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/aboutus/leah.php">Leah Buley</a>, which was totally humbling
and inspiring at the same time. Lots of great stuff that I <em>want</em> to do but am
<em>not</em> doing yet in my UX practice. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ugleah">She has a few preso’s up already on
slideshare</a>, including this same one given last year. The second was
<a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901366">Jared Spool’s talk</a>. I’ve seen Jared speak before so I knew it was going
to be good. It was. Apparently other people knew it was going to be good too.
About two rows in front of me was a who’s who of web design.</p>

<p>Somehow I missed <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901148">this</a> on Sunday, which was dumb of me. After giving the
keynote a miss to go visit <a href="http://www.mellowjohnnys.com/ (Lance Armstrong's new bike shop)">Mellow Johnny’s</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/Quadmod">Jay</a> I wandering in
and out of sessions until stumbling into <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0900377">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>’s Q&amp;A in the
big room. I was so glad I did. My opinion of him did a 180. Previously, I
wasn’t a fan (go <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">here</a> to decide for yourself). But seeing him speak live
to that audience I realized, <em>he’s a motivational speaker</em>, and my kind of
motivational speaker at that: a no bullshit one. Plus he could get Eeyore
excited about life.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/debbieweil/3362991934/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3442/3362991934_e4c64a3595_m.jpg" alt="" /></a>Monday there was some more good stuff going on, but all I really
cared about was the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901379">Bruce Sterling session</a>. I did go to <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0900297">Presenting
Straight to the Brain</a>, which was good, Kathy’s stuff particularly. I have
strong opinions about that stuff, though, and I can’t believe no-one is poo-
pooing panels and telling people to emulate rockstars. Mid-day I got to hang
out with @<a href="http://twitter.com/thedandee">thedandee</a> some more which was a good thing. Eating, as well,
since I hadn’t eaten in about 24 hours. After lunch we both went to the
aforementioned and inspiring <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901322">talk</a> by Kathy. Then, Bruce. He was awesome.</p>

<p>I’ll be <a href="http://huffduffer.com/dealingwith">huffduffing</a> all <a href="http://huffduffer.com/dealingwith/tags/sxsw">the talks I went to plus all the ones I wished
I’d gone to</a>, for those who want to catch/keep up but want a filter. I’ll
probably fill in some gabs with quick vid or pic posts here as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: <a href="http://www.ugleah.com/ux-team-of-one/">Leah Buley has posted the presentation as well as the design
templates she showed off in said presentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157615703262704/ (these are awesome, as always. self-explanatory if u follow the link)"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3430/3371990758_efd7a7fae5_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/03/17/lesson-learned">Khoi Vihn’s SX recap</a>. And Mike D, from the comments:
“Jared Spool? Fantastic. I’d rather watch him talk about peeling carrots for
an hour than listen to five social media consultants introduce themselves for
a half hour and then open up Q &amp; A.”</p>

<p>And finally, the most interesting bit, <a href="http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/">Carissa</a>’s take on the weekend:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3757109&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=dd4499&amp;fullscreen=1">http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3757109&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;
