    <p>In <a href="/2019/01/13/web-log/">my last post</a> I mentioned I was considering making 2019 a <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/">depth year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…take a whole year in which you don’t start anything new or acquire any new possessions you don’t need.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No new hobbies, equipment, games, or books are allowed during this year. Instead, you have to find the value in what you already own or what you’ve already started.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You improve skills rather than learning new ones. You consume media you’ve already stockpiled instead of acquiring more…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was considering not <em>buying anything</em> new (toothpaste, etc aside) in 2019 as part of this experiment, but I think a few simple rules will suffice. I’m already pretty minimalist when it comes to clothes, I haven’t bought a new instrument or bicycle in years (in fact I’ve sold a few bikes). I bought some gadgets last year, I bought or subscribed to some more software. I bought bicycling clothes (to the point I probably won’t need any more this year). So far I haven’t bought anything from Amazon in 2019. I have subscribed to one new software service this year (more on that in a later post–it’s still my best-kept secret).</p>

<p>So taking stock:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hobbies:
    <ul>
      <li>Bicycling</li>
      <li>Writing and playing music (I would really like to <em>return</em> to this in 2019, at least a little)</li>
      <li>Writing words</li>
      <li>Gaming</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Equipment: all either related to the above or a gadget. This will mean no new phone in 2019, something I wasn’t planning on anyway. Should my current phone break I will consider a replacement exempt from these rules. But no new smart home devices, watches, mechanical keyboards (I just got my second, which I purchased last year), and the really tough one: no new computer. I’ve been shopping for one that both the kids and I could use to play Minecraft on. (Penn has kidnapped the only working laptop in the house owned by me.)</li>
  <li>Games: I have discovered a new (free) game online in the last week or so. I’ve played a little bit but I’m not sure how invested I will get in it. It is a potential source material for my Minecraft education curriculum (although not Minecraft). It is entirely written in javascript and all its controls are via the keyboard; both aspects are fascinating. Possibly more on this game in a future post. But no new-new games, I guess.</li>
  <li>Books: I have so many! I certainly do not need to obtain any more this year. I do need to just read what I have. Books prescribed by my employer or a professional mentor will be considered exempt.</li>
  <li>Learning new skills: I’m fairly certain the author of this thing really means new hobby-skills; obviously I need to continue to grow in my profession, which involves a multitude of skills. Although he mentions learning French, so in my case it could mean a new programming language. I’m already so behind in the languages I already know that this temptation isn’t much of a problem. I still need to go deeper on ES6, React, Ruby and Rails.</li>
  <li>Media consumption: now that everything is streaming, I’m not sure about this particular one. I’m still going to watch my YouTube subscriptions, which I keep pretty well groomed. I only occasionally watch Netflix. I enjoy new music. I often go deep with old music as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my rules are pretty well laid out in the above. No new bike or musical equipment (this means the home recording setup I keep dreaming of will have to wait, as will learning Ableton or some other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</a>). No new gadgets. No new books. No new games. No new hobbies (not that I’ve had time to even pursue my old ones). No new giant projects (writing, software, records [not that I have any songs]).</p>

<p>What I’d really like to go deep on are relationships. But that, I suppose, is yet another future post.</p>
