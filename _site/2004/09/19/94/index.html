    <p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/koaloha/29646.html">Crazy Train or Emotional Subway Attack</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This morning I had the most bizarre subway ride. I board the Number 3 train
at Grand Army Plaza after 9 a.m. Find a seat, then settle into reading Henry
James for class. I hear a woman’s voice gradually rising in volume. She is
preaching the “Lord’s” word to the train car’s sleepy riders. Of course, I had
forgotten the headphones for my subway evil sounds blocking device. The train
stops and starts. The words denigrating “gay devils” reach my ears. I stand
up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me: “Excuse me, but do you mind keeping your voice down, I am trying to read.”</p>

<p>Preacher Lady: (screams) “I got to testify.”</p>

<p>Preacher lady hitches up her skirts and tells me that I am going to hell for
interrupting you-know-who’s word. Two or three OTHER Christian ladies on the
train start shouting at me and discussing my prospects as the Devil’s prison
bitch. The last straw was a 50 something red faced man in a suit slamming his
Bible towards my face. There was only one thing I could do.</p>

<p>Me: “If you all don’t lower your voices and cease calling me Satan, I will
have to sing show tunes.”</p>

<p>The other straphangers look at me with stony faces. I begin to sing. “Its very
clear, our love is here to stay. Not for a year, but forever and a day…”</p>

<p>Preacher lady and the Jesus police start mumbling and beseeching G_d to strike
me down and boil me in molten tar. (I look better in silver.) The train
reaches Wall Street. Confused subway riders check out the scene. I begin
swaying and feeling the music.</p>

<p>The slamming Bible man looks like he is going to pop a blood vessel. “I cast
ye out, Satan.”</p>

<p>I go into jazz dance crouch and then spring up to belt out, “THAAAAAAT OLD
BLACK MAGIC, HAS ME IN A SPELL…”</p>

<p>Bible man has to get off the train as I wriggle and shimmy. “That same old
witchcraft when your eyes meet mine!”</p>

<p>Bible man exits. SHOW TUNES 1, FUNDAMENTALISTS 0.</p>

<p>“So when you walk alone and forlorn, and hear that Cadillac horn remember,
love isn’t born, its made…and that’s why every window has a window shade…bad a
biddle be bop…”</p>

<p>I try to discuss freedom of religion with the ladies, but all attempts at
reasonable discourse fail.</p>

<p>By 34th street, the last of the Christian word warriors has left the train. 3
subway riders shake my hand and say, “I have always wanted to tell those
idiots to shut up! Bless you.”</p>

<p>I am shaking. I don’t know what comes over me at times like this. I only know
that I cannot stay silent. I wish that I had my ukulele with me.</p>

<p>At 42nd street, a woman strides into the car and starts PREACHING. The entire
car bursts into laughter. I interrupt this new preacher lady and note that she
is wearing a flowered straw bonnet.</p>

<p>Me: “Excuse me, Ma’am…but I must warn you that there has been a 12 subway stop
donnybrook regarding the unwanted intrusion of religious beliefs into our
morning commutes.”</p>

<p>Preacher Lady 2: “I got freedom of speech! And GOD TELLS ME THAT THE GAY
DEVILS ARE CONTROLLING NEW YORK.”</p>

<p>Me: (standing up) “If you do not cease and desist fouling the air with
homophobia, I must sing…SHOW TUNES.”</p>

<p>There are now 3 or 4 gay men on the train. They start laughing.</p>

<p>Preacher Lady 2: “The Lawd says you are going to …” (litany of punishments
that would be fun with the right person).</p>

<p>Me: (sings) “The Girl that I marry will have to be, as soft and as sweet as a
nursery… the girl I call my own, will wear diamonds and laces and smell of
cologne…”</p>

<p>One of the boys on the train starts to harmonize.</p>

<p>Preacher Lady 2 makes her way down the car, pointing and exclaiming, “I have
met the devil right here!”</p>

<p>Me: (sings) “Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets…”</p>

<p>Dancing around the subway poles and doing my best Gwen Verdon kicks, I feel
the spirit in me.</p>

<p>I close with “Pennies from Heaven” and make sure to get the Jazz Hands in for
good measure.</p>

<p>As Preacher Lady 2 runs to the next car at 72nd Street, the doors open, a
perfect end of song button for my gay pointing gesture.</p>

<p>The subway riders break into applause and I bow. Rock on.</p>

<p>Several straphangers whisper, Happy New Year to me in Hebrew.</p>

<p>An Orthodox lady hands me an orange.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I should laugh or cry.</p>
