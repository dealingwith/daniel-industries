Penn, in his 4th year of the 5-year arch program at Arkansas, attended this earlier this summer, and described it as life-changing. I cognitively understood the factors involved, but getting to watch this video about it brought it home emotionally. I was filled with joy and hope. And I was holding it together until the end, when they showed the stake with his name on it being driven into the ground. I sobbed tears of joy. Which hasn't happened in a long time.

I had more thoughts about all of this, but thoughts have become increasingly elusive...so I leave it at that...
