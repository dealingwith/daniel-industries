Yesterday was a disaster; I don t even want to record it.

Today I'm on my fourth at 3:33 here inside.

But I ran around with the dog this afternoon, doing a _tiny_ bit of freerunning or whatever it was called, trying to get him to jump over stuff and whatnot (no luck there really). Later I had the thought that I actually _wanted_ to work out, feeling a little soreness in my legs from the jumping; took me back to my _actually in shape_ days, that great feeling of sore muscles and some extra hormones floating about the bloodstream.

The dog went to the vet yesterday and got some medicine for his GI infection, and wasn't allowed to eat yesterday. Poor dude is starving; I'm only giving him a tiny bit of food at a time today. He found an old nasty piece of bread at the park and even after I led him away from it a long way, when I let him off the leash he ran all the way back there to have at it again. I had to run to catch up to him and lead him all the way out of the park. Poor starving dude!
