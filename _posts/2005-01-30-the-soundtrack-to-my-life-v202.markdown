I'm not sure who's singing these songs to whom, but they are the ones that have stuck out at me lately. 17 songs, 5 artists, nothing I've uploaded here before (although many of you may have most or all of these already); but I'm not telling what's in there. If things go badly, I am going to do something cool with this playlist, although the order in the m3u file might not be final if that is the case.
