> Oh God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know  

> And I want to know you  
> Like an invitation  
> We have only questions  
> Bless these limitations  

> And I want to see you  
> In the tree tops swaying  
> But I'll always find you  
> In the wet grass saying  
> "God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know"  

> And oh what graceful patterns  
> That repeat then scatter  
> If my steps seem random  
> And my will abandoned  
> The machine elves whisper  
> "Let the matter settle  
> Worrying is praying  
> Praying to the devil"  

> God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know

> ...worry -- the insistent anxiety in regards to imagined futures. Not only is worry a fruitless loss of energy and calm, it leads us away from participation in the moment, where the real future is actually created. By neglecting the choices that actually lie before us, we invoke the very situations we have imaginatively constructed for ourselves.

> In the capsule of experience which is given to us each instant, we determine who we are and what is significant to us. The whole of our lives is presented to us in the moment, and each moment is an intersection with eternity in which we decide our destiny and are offered the grace of becoming. All else is illusion.

-- Mike Riddell, from _Sacred Journey_
