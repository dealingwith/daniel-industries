> Oh God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know  

> And I want to know you  
> Like an invitation  
> We have only questions  
> Bless these limitations  

> And I want to see you  
> In the tree tops swaying  
> But I'll always find you  
> In the wet grass saying  
> "God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know"  

> And oh what graceful patterns  
> That repeat then scatter  
> If my steps seem random  
> And my will abandoned  
> The machine elves whisper  
> "Let the matter settle  
> Worrying is praying  
> Praying to the devil"  

> God is simply that which lies  
> Forever just beyond the limits  
> Of what we already seem to know
