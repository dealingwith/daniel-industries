Picked up The Slack's _Wishful Sinking_ tonight and it surpasses my admittedly high expectations. And the lyrics read like someone who's been watching my life for the last 18 months. _You Deserve Better_, which was on the Zack Crain for Mayor CD. _Leaving Chicago_ is a beautiful, lonely lament. His choice of city leaves me with an uncomfortable conviction that I must embrace, having myself been alone in distant locations left with wonder at what's left back home.

> falling out with you  
> it weighs me down with truth...

> will tomorrow bring a sun to sing a song for spring?  
> now the fear rings in my ear...

_Nothing New_ has this awesome Pet Sounds intro eventually landing into that hook-filled Holt songwriting and guitar playing that we love.

> she smiles at you when she speaks of nothing new  
> still you won't believe the lies  
> ...it comes as no surprise  
> she knows the fear it'll break you down  
> so now you're here alone and she'll go so far away  
> still you won't concede it's wrong  
> i don't belong to her

> i feel so gone today  
> she won't believe not a single word  
> but still you want to know  
> will she come around again

_Breaking Down_ is a classic _eff you_ rock tune reminiscent of something I can't quite put my finger on (post punk?)

> you stand in front of me  
> set off too easily  
> you're surely telling everyone that i'm a bastard...

> i'll hold you up til you put me out  
> might be better if you're not around...

> making plans to be in charge of everything...

> with all the rumors that flood the town  
> it's obvious we're both contradicting  
> now all i can say it's a shame  
> the idiot's to blame  

> and i feel let down  
> and i'm so alone...  
> i'm so fucking alone...

> i wish we could stop talking bout  
> every single word coming from my mouth  
> even though you hear me when i shout  
> i know it's not getting through...

I like that the record closes with three positive tracks, the beautiful _Weathering the Storm_ (_I know it's easier said than done but have a little faith in your heart...I'm staying true to form, I'm weathering the storm_), which goes right into _The Big Picture_ (_I knew you were the light for me...I lost sight for awhile but soon I'll find my feet_), and the standout _What's to Come_

> the wait is the hardest thing to take  
> i pray i don't make the same mistake  
> but i'm so lost today   
> i admit being guilty of the sin  
> i knocked on the door and you begged me to come in  
> time and time again

> i can live with what i've done  
> if only for the promise of what's to come...

...like I said...and I would give you that track too, but I want you to buy this record (and there's not a weak track on the whole thing). I got it at Good Records, which has it at a listening booth, and it's also available at CD World. For non-Dallasites, it will hopefully soon be available on iTunes (I assume in all its DRM'd glory).

The Slack is kind of the answer to all of Johnny Citizen's questions, both musically and lyrically. But neither of us are trying to be anything we aren't. We aren't clever. We're just artists, specifically musicians and songwriters.
