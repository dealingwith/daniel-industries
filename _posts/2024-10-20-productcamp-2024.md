Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending [ProductCamp Dallas](https://www.linkedin.com/company/productcampdallas/)' unconference for the first time since 2018. It was informative and fun, and I met many new product people.

[Last time](/2018/03/11/product-camp/), I left a little confused and discouraged. It felt more like ProjectCamp. This time was the opposite: clarity and encouragement! ðŸ¥³

These people are knowledgeable about what it actually takes to build a great software product---the science _and_ the art. They read Marty Cagan and John Cutler. They don't let their tools dictate their process. They work closely with their coworkers both on the business development and software development sides of the house.

I rode my bicycle to the venue downtown, which I realized only as I entered was OrderMyGear's HQ. It's in a very old, beautiful building in the East Quarter neighborhood. Dallas so rarely does old or beautiful, this town is more about tear down and build new and milquetoast, so it was an immediate pleasure to realize I'd be spending the day in this space.

As they invited last-second talk pitches for the unconference format (the attendees are also the speakers), I was inspired to pitch an "AMA with a CTO". I actually pitched "Q&A" but the event organizer was smarter than me and put it down as AMA, which is obviously a superior moniker.

It was voted in, and to my surprise well attended. The questions started coming in and they were all my favorite topics! After the third question I quipped, "It's like I planted the audience." They even led one to the next in a logical way that allowed me to expand on the themes I'd begun expressing in previous answers.

I don't remember all the questions, but there were the ones I expected about communication---not just with engineers but with executives. There was a question about how to get started with learning technical subjects for the purpose of being better product managers! I don't remember anyone thinking like that in 2018. And there was even a couple of questions that delved a little bit into the ethics of technology. I said something like, "I'm not going to turn this into an ethics lecture, but..." That was me sidestepping the fact that I am unqualified to give any ethics lectures. I try my best, I might even think about it more than the average CTO, but I'm far from an expert in the topic. 

I got to talk to a lot of people afterwards and when they gave feedback on my "talk" it was positive. I was humbled and delighted, and grateful to be made to think about these topics and speak in front of an audience. It had been a while.

I attended other talks and sessions. My favorite was the final session, a group discussion on various topics, where the vibe was: _**all** these people here are smart!_

I'm grateful that in this post-pandemic moment when so many IRL industry events have not come back, ProductCamp Dallas leadership has made the effort to keep it going. Right before I headed back home, I was discussing with one of the organizers how RSVPs seem to have no significance anymore, and how planning something is made considerably more difficult when the actual-attendees-to-RSVPs ratio has gone from ~60% ~5 years ago to more like ~30% now. ðŸ˜•
