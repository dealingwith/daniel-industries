**[aftersome](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/640050819017867264/aftersome)**

> _adj._ astonished to think back on the bizarre sequence of accidents that brought you to where you are today—as if you’d spent years bouncing down a Plinko pegboard, passing through a million harmless decision points, any one of which might’ve changed everything—which makes your long and winding path feel fated from the start, yet so unlikely as to be virtually impossible.

**[semaphorism](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/35393387025/semaphorism)**

> _n._ a conversational hint that you have something personal to say on the subject but don’t go any further—an emphatic nod, a half-told anecdote, an enigmatic ‘I know the feeling'—which you place into conversations like those little flags that warn diggers of something buried underground: maybe a cable that secretly powers your house, maybe a fiberoptic link to some foreign country.

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the number of things in the world you know very little or nothing about? That's the feeling I was trying to find a word for. It seems like the older I get, the better I understand the vastness of all human knowledge, and I'm more aware that the time I have to understand even a tiny part of it is rapidly slipping away. Like [sonder](/2014/06/26/sonder/) but instead of human experience, human knowledge.

There are words that come close. Ignoramus. Naiveté. I assembled _[sciolistic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciolism) [sciamachies](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciamachy)_ just exploring words in the vicinity of what I'm trying to express.
