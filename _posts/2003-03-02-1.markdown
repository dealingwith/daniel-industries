> I think I'd tell him  
> About fast cars on open roads  
> 8th birthday parties  
> And Arsenal's disappointing away form  
> I hope he'd tell me  
> About his favourite star  
> Why sheep exist  
> And how he thought of photosynthesis  
>   
> By the second jug  
> We'd move to sit by the fire  
> Have a couple of cigars  
> And a packet of peanuts  
>   
> I think I'd get angry  
> And ask Him  
> About rape and HIV and Hiroshima and cot-death  
> Then he'd get even angrier  
> And ask Me  
> About rape and HIV and Hiroshima and cot-death

> And then  
> Then maybe we'd sit quietly  
> And sup our pints  
> The fire would burn  
> The logs would crackle  
> And the world would turn

> After a while I'd tell him a story  
> He'd tell me a joke  
> And we'd play a few games of dominoes.  

I heard this poem read at a [dfg](http://www.thedfgcorporation.co.uk/) performance at the last [greenbelt](http://www.greenbelt.org.uk) and loved it (along with the rest of their performance which also includes music and drama...tons and tons of high british drama!). I particularly like the "I think I'd get angry..." verse. (via [Steve](http://www.smallritual.org/))
