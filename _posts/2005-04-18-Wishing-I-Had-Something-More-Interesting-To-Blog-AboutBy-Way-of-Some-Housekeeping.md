VAST -- _Dont Take your Love Away From Me_

...also check out Amos Lee--good stuff! _Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight_, _Seen It All Before_, _Bottom of the Barrel_ ...there are some more up there but I'll make you look for 'em.

If anyone has any of my VHS/DVD's, Chuck Palahniuk books, or Mike Riddell books, could you please return them sometime soon? Anyone with the new Iron and Wine wanna put it on the mediashare?

I was a little concerned when I posted that picture of dogs humping that someone would think one of them was my dog, Pavlov. Of course, I haven't mentioned my dog yet, <a class="dead">only Dan has</a>. I got him from the <a href="http://www.spca.org">SPCA</a> in January. He's a 36lbs chocolate lab/chow/whatever mix and mostly a lot of trouble.
Here's a picture of him, looking much meaner than he is, playing with his best friend in the world, Perlican:
