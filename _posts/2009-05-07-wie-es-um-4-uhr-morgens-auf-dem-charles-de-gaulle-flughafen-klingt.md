[My songs were featured on a German online radio show][2], I can't find an mp3 to download, but the gist of it was about free music in these troubled economic times. I don't know how they found me but I'm stoked! (Although I think they misunderstood the meaning of "[What Am I Supposed to Do?][4]")

"[We hear what it sounds like at 4 in the morning in Charles de Gaulle _Flughafen_][5]" they totally got right, though.
