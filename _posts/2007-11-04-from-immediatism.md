> Many monsters stand between us & realization of Immediatist goals. For instance our own ingrained unconscious alienation might all to easily be mistaken for a virtue, especially when contrasted with crypto-authoritarian pap passed off as "community," or with various upscale versions of "leisure." Isn't it natural to take the _dandyism noir_ of curmudgeonly hermits for some kind of heroic individualism, when the only visible contrast is Club Med commodity socialism, or the gemutlich[^1] masochism of the Victim Cults? To be doomed & cool naturally appeals more to noble souls than to be saved & cozy.

> ...What must be overcome is not individuality per se, but rather the addiction to bitter loneliness which characterizes consciousness in the 20th century (which is by & large not much more than a re-run of the 19th).

> ...The first & most innocent-seeming obstacle to any Immediatist project will be the "busyness" or "need to make a living" faced by each of its associates.

> ...Yes, perhaps it's true we can't "live" with a job -- although I hope we're grown-up enough to know the difference between _life_ & the accumulation of a bunch of fucking _gadgets_.

[^1]: comfortable and pleasant; cozy.
