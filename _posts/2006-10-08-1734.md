See more progress on: _I am finding where I fit. The answer is revealing itself to me. When I discover it, success will come easier and more often_.

This is possibly the best goal I've put into 43 Things. I get an email reminder every week. It's more an affirmation, right? I got it from [...]...whose coaching I'm currently employing (just the intro level...mental note: $1 trials work!). There's something weird about new-agey types and services...they seem to work! Bottom line is I'm thinking about slowly transitioning all my 43 Things to more affirmation-like statements, then getting the weekly reminder. I quite like it. The coaching audio I just listened to was about gratitude. I think I might add that presently.
