I've been working on some new projects that will require websites (among many other technical bits). These are proper businesslike projects, but they are also personal, and I want the design of said websites to express creativity and authenticity. As someone who has been making websites for over twenty years, I started with a plan to hand-write some HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript, but I needed some inspiration. What I found in my brief attempt to find some web design that inspired me were:

1. The truly awful. These comprise the vast majority of websites in 2023, and are the topic of frequent discussions within the online community of web design and development professionals I lurk within.
2. The boring. These are typically online stores or business pages based on a template and built in WordPress, Squarespace, or the like. The templates vary very little even across domains, and even less within a specific domain. 
3. The maximalist. Some designers, in an attempt to not be boring, create heavyweight sites with a lot of moving graphics. They sacrifice usability and discoverability for their brand. That's their decision and is fine, but not what I'm looking for.
4. The minimalist. Most of the valuable content I find online is on personal websites, and the majority of those tend towards the minimalist, much like this very site.

Upon not finding anything that was both interesting visually, creative, and usable, I wondered: What did I think I was going to find? Why do I remember the existance of such sites? I thought back to the early-to-mid-2000s. I tried to recollect the names of some of the sites I enjoyed in that era. I finally stumbled upon the [Web Design Museum](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/ "Web Design Museum exhibits thousands of websites that chronicle forgotten trends in web design from its beginnings in the 1990s to the mid-00s."). I was reminded of [Submethod](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/submethod-2001), [Designgraphik](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/golden-age-of-web-design/designgraphik-2001), and [Surfstation](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/golden-age-of-web-design/surfstation-2001). The Web Design Museum even has a category called the "[Golden Age of Web Design](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/golden-age-of-web-design "Relive the golden age of the Internet: Discover the most influential web design trends that were popular at the turn of the millennium.")." These were the types of sites I was looking for---sites with quality text and images, intentionally placed within a browser window, novel navigation elements, where curiosity was encouraged and rewarded. 

I even found Dallas' own [Jared Christensen](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/css-layout-pioneers/jared-christensen-2005) in the [CSS Layout Pioneers](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/css-layout-pioneers) category.
