I was just cleaning up some old paperwork and stumbled across this letter again. In 2006 I closed the doors of [Integration Research](/2016/03/15/goodbye-integration-research/), and as a nonprofit with $4,643.31 still in its coffers, that money had to be distributed to other similar nonprofit entities. The organizations we chose were [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org), [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org), and [Turbulence.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Radio_and_Performing_Arts). All three wrote letters to us thanking us for our contributions, but Helen Thorington's personal response has stayed with me in the intervening years.

> I'm stunned.

It's funny how a simple choice of two words can impact someone.

Of the three, Turbulence.org is the only one no longer in operation. All three were/are important entities in the world of digital art.

Today, I decided to look Helen up. She passed in 2023 at the age of 94.

You can have a look on archive.org at [what turbulence.org looked like around the time we made our donation](https://web.archive.org/web/20061230222207/http://www.turbulence.org/). You can view an archive of the work it supported and curated at [the-next.eliterature.org](https://the-next.eliterature.org/collections/17).

[You can listen to some of Helen's work on archive.org as well](https://archive.org/details/helen_thorington).

[Here is a French podcast episode from 2018 featuring her](https://archive.org/details/LRdP07LaboHelenThorington). I wish I could understand what she was saying in this audio, but any non-native person speaking French will never not impress me.

The late 90s and early 00s were a golden age for internet art. Alternative artists like Helen brought their rich education and practice from pre-internet art onto the web. The artifacts that these obscure archives manage to maintain are remarkable evidence of the kind of creativity that flourished in the age between Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the World Wide Web in 1989 and the vapidization of all things[^1] online enacted by modern social media starting in the late 00s. My humble contribution to that space was inspired by Helen and many others like her.

[^1]: Of course, not everything online these days is terrible. I recently started supporting [Never Post, A Podcast About and For the Internet](https://www.neverpo.st/), something that was on my list to do, but after listening to their latest episode, [The One Thing You Can Do For Yourself](https://www.neverpo.st/the-one-thing-you-can-do-for-yourself/), I decided their work was _important_ and if I could help perpetuate it I needed to. That is just one example of many.
