_we don't need no bridges, let the mother-fuckers burn!_

...not that there was one anyway...

So, apparently our term installation has been <a class="dead">co-opted</a>. ðŸ¤¬ Time to think of new terminology. In some cases, imitation is not flattery...

At least no one so smiley-Jesus-y would ever use the name _christian porn machine_

And one more thing while I'm being a nasty asshole, <a class="dead">not finding a house to buy or an apt to lease</a>, or just about any other environmental "hardship" known in this country, is NOT A TRIAL FROM GOD!! There are millions of people who have never had a roof over their head in their lives! STARVATION, LAND MINES, and CANCER are TRIALS and "not much fun."

Just a friendly reminder to Americans everywhere...
