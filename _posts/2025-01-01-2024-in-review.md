### Coming into 2024

[Last year](/2024/01/06/2023-in-review/), I left my day job and started new projects. This year, I started new projects, then left all the projects and started a new day job.

I actually [ended my EOY review before I started it last year](/2024/01/03/2023-in-review-postscript/), where I quoted [Kung Fu Monkey](https://buttondown.email/kungfumonkey/archive/hey-go-easy-on-yourself-in-2024/ "Hey, Go Easy on Yourself in 2024"), who took their own advice and only posted twice more in 2024. They were probably busy [actually writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)) I wrote 56 posts, including this [this shit](/2024/10/28/the-trouble-with-tools/ "This already sounds like a mess, and it is").

### Finally

[make art in order to keep living](https://write.as/malena/make-art-in-order-to-keep-living)

> There is no logical path through that madness. We only get nauseous trying to thread those impossible needles. It’s poetry that captures what’s going on, because it points to the spaces between the lines.

[fixing the world](https://write.as/malena/nov-8-2024-fixing-the-world)

> The ideology of perpetual fixing is pretty cool I think. It holds that we're always broken and yet always capable of repair. But there's a warning in it: if we lose this self-identity, as communities subservient to our own collective repair, than we just keep breaking.
>
> ...Capital loves the image of the lone fisherman out on the stormy seas. In reality fisherfolk stay in when it’s stormy and when we break down we tow one another home and then tie together into safe harbor, mended lines lashing a broken boat to a working one.
> 
> A fishing community is always repairing its gear. Boat repair is 75% of the manual labor we do.
>
> If we took this personally, if we were insulted by the fact that our boat can break down, we would be in fact preparing to sink.
