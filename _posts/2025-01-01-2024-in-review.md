### Coming into 2024

[Last year](/2024/01/06/2023-in-review/), I left my day job and started new projects. This year, I started new projects, then left all the projects and started a new day job.

I actually [ended my EOY review before I started it last year](/2024/01/03/2023-in-review-postscript/), where I quoted [Kung Fu Monkey](https://buttondown.email/kungfumonkey/archive/hey-go-easy-on-yourself-in-2024/ "Hey, Go Easy on Yourself in 2024"), who took their own advice and only posted twice more in 2024. They were probably busy [actually writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)) I wrote 56 posts, including this [this shit](/2024/10/28/the-trouble-with-tools/ "This already sounds like a mess, and it is").

### Health aka becoming an old and the state of US healthcare

#### Eyes

2024:

> My eyesight started to degrade in an alarmingly rapid fashion. I went to the eye doctor towards the beginning of the summer and all they could suggest were dry eyes and to use drops.

Went to a different eye doctor--within the same chain--for this year's eye checkup and this one was actually capable and get me into some mid-distance glasses for use at my computer that changed my life. I suffered for an extra year for no reason. I often forget to switch back to my normal glasses when getting up from my desk, however, which is 😵‍💫

#### Foot

> I haven't looked into PT or some foot-specific exercises and stretches, but that's on the short list. After the consistent failures of the medical field I've experienced in the last few years, I'm holding off on consulting a doctor at this point. 

I ended up at PT and an orthopedic doctor. PT accurately diagnosed my issue as [Tarsal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsal_tunnel_syndrome), but PT didn't help. The doctor prescribed orthotic shoe footbeds, which helped a little bit. I had a follow-up appointment with that doctor, but after waiting in a room for one hour I left. There was also the issue of my self-bought health insurance expiring; I repurchased the exact same plan to get us through 2024, but now my foot was a preexisting condition that the new plan--again, just to reiterate, was the same plan with the same company--would not cover.

I got some new cycling footbeds with the highest arch support; those also seemed to help a little bit. But I've found I still can't ride longer than an hour or two without pain.

#### Riding recap

So my cycling was very consistent year-over-year, but comprised mostly of short (15-20 mile) rides around White Rock Lake in the mornings.

| Year | Milage |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2021 | 3,786  |
| 2022 | 3,582  |
| 2023 | 3,466  |
| 2024 | 3,532  |

I rode 30 miles January 1st and decided maybe it's finally time to seriously incorporate some other exercise into my life.

Milo rode more in 2024. We converted his 26" bike's flat bars to drop bars. He raced in the state championship road race again. He was much faster this year but placed lower due to increased competition. His mother and sister came along which was cool. That race is the only one with anything for his age group that is close enough to make it worthwhile, and we still have to drive down the day before and stay in a hotel, as the race is about a three hour drive away and starts at dawn.

#### Depression

I'm now relatively certain that I was able to get off meds in 2023 due to very consistent cycling and accidental increase in magnesium consumption. I'm now taking magnesium daily, and if I don't bicycle or take magnesium for a few days I can feel the ground get slippery beneath my feet. Figuring out the magnesium thing was a journey; I can share my findings directly with anyone who is curious.

### Finally

> There is no logical path through that madness. We only get nauseous trying to thread those impossible needles. It’s poetry that captures what’s going on, because it points to the spaces between the lines.

[fixing the world](https://write.as/malena/nov-8-2024-fixing-the-world)

> The ideology of perpetual fixing is pretty cool I think. It holds that we're always broken and yet always capable of repair. But there's a warning in it: if we lose this self-identity, as communities subservient to our own collective repair, than we just keep breaking.
>
> ...Capital loves the image of the lone fisherman out on the stormy seas. In reality fisherfolk stay in when it’s stormy and when we break down we tow one another home and then tie together into safe harbor, mended lines lashing a broken boat to a working one.
> 
> A fishing community is always repairing its gear. Boat repair is 75% of the manual labor we do.
>
> If we took this personally, if we were insulted by the fact that our boat can break down, we would be in fact preparing to sink.
