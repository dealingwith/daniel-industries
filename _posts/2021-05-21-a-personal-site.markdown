Naz Hamid: [Hi, this is a personal site (again)](https://nazhamid.com/posts/a-personal-site/)

> ...I’ve been writing on and off on the web since 1998, and those early years only live on as database archives, not easily parsed by tables and database schemas. I could run an SQL query someday, but I doubt there’s much of consequence aside from the journaling of a person in their early 20s.

> As a number of friends have re-embraced blogging and personal sites, and old friends have continued to publish all these years later, I’ve certainly felt the good pressure to carve out a home on the web again that’s all my own...

> I started with a completely different design but found myself one day perusing old drives with designs of my old sites and realize that I still loved that energy and aesthetic, and grids and simplicity have always been something I’ve gravitated to in my own work...

> And a damn RSS feed. Because I still read blogs via RSS.

> (remember those and the current revival and how amazing blogs can be?)

To which I thought, "There's a current blog revival?" Naz is one of the original a-list web design people I've followed since what feels like forever. I found the above validating of my twenty years maintaining this site.
