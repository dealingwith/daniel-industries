title: 'Do things by not trying to make yourself do them'
---

_Focusing on something for 5 minutes, much less for an entire month, is difficult, though. I'm just not very good at motivating myself about some things--it's almost easier to find a way to trick myself into believing that I don't need to be motivated. Do things by not trying to make yourself do them-- do them the Tyler Durden way, while you're not paying attention, while you're sleeping._
