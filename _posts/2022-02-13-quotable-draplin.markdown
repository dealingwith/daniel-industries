> I lock in on design that’s functional and beautiful, especially after seeing the bullshit in the mid-’90s with all the post-post-post modern scratchy, scritchity design shit that was going on. That was just fashion---frivolous and elite.

> I like things that work, things that never go out of style. I don’t know if it’s a ‘style’ as such, as it’s a lack of taking the bait on all the new shit. Why do [famed US designer] Saul Bass logos still work? Therein lies what I’m trying to draft off.

> I’m not looking too hard into describing contemporary design anymore, I’m too busy doing my own thing. But I will say this much, I’m seeing an understanding of ‘good design’ out there more and more like on Pinterest. Seeing my little sisters finding reference points, and learning how to design their homes through it. That’s design.

> Designers are obsessive. What other way is there to be? I’d be freaked out if someone answered ‘no’ to this. It’s the little details that set so much shit apart.
