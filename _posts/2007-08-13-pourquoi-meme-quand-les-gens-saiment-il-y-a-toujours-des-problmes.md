Listening to a lot of Manu Chao this morning:

_Je ne t'aime plus_ (Oh how I wish it were true. I don't think he means it when he sings it, either, though.)

_Mentira_ (Indeed.)

(Title of this post not from either of these, but rather from _La Vie a Deux_) (The record _Esperanza_ is also very good.)
