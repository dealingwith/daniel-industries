> The push for endless growth and scalability comes from multiple places. There’s the capitalist imperative: anything worth doing should generate profit. There’s the social media amplification effect: if something isn’t documented and shared, did it really happen? Finally, there’s the efficiency trap: why do something for ten people when you could do it for ten thousand?

> These forces combine to create a kind of growth obligation — a sense that remaining small or finite is somehow a moral failure. It’s a bullshit mindset that misses the whole nature of human experience and satisfaction.

> Think about a conversation with a close friend. Would it be "better" if that conversation reached millions? Would its value increase if it were scaled up into a TED talk? Of course it fucking wouldn’t. Some experiences derive meaning precisely from their intimacy, privacy and bounded nature.

> The same applies to creative and intellectual pursuits. A zine printed in 100 copies and distributed at local coffee shops might create a more meaningful impact than a viral blog post read by millions but forgotten in days. A community art project that brings together thirty neighbors will almost certainly generate more lasting value than an NFT collection worth millions. But even if they don’t --it wouldn’t make them any less worthy as a human pursuit.

> What about the argument that scaling up allows more people to benefit from something good? This reasoning seems noble, but it misses something important.

> Take the example of a neighborhood potluck dinner. You could theoretically “scale it up” into a massive food festival. You could create an app to coordinate similar events across cities. You could franchise the concept and create “authentic neighborhood dining experiences” for tourists.

> But each step toward scale strips away the qualities that made the original valuable: the intimate knowledge of neighbors, the trust built over the years, the inside jokes, the familiar dishes, the comfortable silences. The scaled version might be successful by certain metrics, but it would be a fundamentally different thing.

...

> These bounded endeavors serve another crucial function: they act as counterweights to the increasingly automated, optimized, and scaled nature of modern life. When algorithms curate our entertainment and AI systems handle customer service interaction, small-scale human activities take on a new kind of significance.

> Not everything needs to be efficient. Not everything needs to be optimized. Not everything needs to reach millions of people to matter.

> The worth of a bounded endeavor isn’t measured by growth, reach, or profit. It’s measured by the depth of engagement, the quality of experience, and the meaning generated for those involved. Sometimes, the optimal outcome is to have done something well, created something meaningful, and then let it go.
