[Radiohead’s _Creep_: The One Song They Couldn't Escape](https://www.theringer.com/2021/11/17/22785868/radiohead-creep-pablo-honey-history)

> I am here to once again try and fail to convey to you young people the existential crisis that was CD shopping in 1993. I am almost definitely not saying this to you for the last time. If you wanted to listen to an album—one album, by anybody—your mother had to drive you to a second location and you had to buy the album for basically $20. $20 got you one album and, like, a pretzel. Yes, I said _existential crisis_.

He goes on to describe how he walked around record stores with [Bandwagonesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagonesque) in his hands for hours in total, but never bought it. [Ferment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferment_(album)), however, he did buy. He even mentions my favorite underrated band from the 90s, [Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada_(band)). I've thrown together a playlist with a bunch of Radiohead and those three bands and I'm so pleased.
