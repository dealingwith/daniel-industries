> I’m a person who’s only satisfied if I feel I’m being productive. I like figuring things out. I like making things. And I want to do as much of that as I can. And part of being able to do that is to have the best personal infrastructure I can. Over the years I’ve been steadily accumulating and implementing “personal infrastructure hacks” for myself. Some of them are, yes, quite nerdy. But they certainly help me be productive...

[Seeking the Productive Life: Some Details of My Personal Infrastructure](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/) then continues with about 12,000 more words of _some detail_.

I haven't read this entire thing, and I can't recommend doing so. I sent it to Carissa with: "just scan and be amazed or horrified or both."

However, if you think the wholehearted pursuit of productivity is interesting or foolhardy, it sure is interesting when taken to this extreme.
