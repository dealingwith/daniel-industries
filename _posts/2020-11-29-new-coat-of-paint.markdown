It all started pretty late last night as I emerged from a multi-day funk. I was working through some of the more recently captured cards on my board (including the one with the [Linux setup tips I used](/2020/11/28/tweaking-the-setup/)) and had one to look into [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), specifically something simple like a [minimal blog template](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/templates/minimal-blog). We're using Tailwind at work so something like throwing fresh paint on my blog seemed like the kind of thing that might give me a good introduction.

I ended up using [a different "minimalist" blog template](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/templates/minimalist-blog) and stayed up really late and spent most of the morning getting it all working the way I wanted. For hours and hours I didn't even think to open email or glance at social media, and it was glorious.

I even moved it all into a fresh repo and for some reason Jekyll _just worked_ more than it ever has. I keep looking for a reason to switch up the engine, but Jekyll just keeps doing really well for me.

I do need to figure out how to actually [build Tailwind with Jekyll](https://mdoliwa.com/2020/08/22/how-to-setup-jekyll-with-tailwind-css.html) but that will have to wait.
