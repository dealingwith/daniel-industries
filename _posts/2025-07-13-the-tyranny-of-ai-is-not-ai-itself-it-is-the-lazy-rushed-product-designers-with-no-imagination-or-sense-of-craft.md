## Let's talk about product naming

Since "assistants" became a thing--10 years ago? 15 years ago?--they needed names, and they were often bad.

- Google Assistant. Good job. Keep is simple, stupid.
- Alexa. [Sorry everyone who named their child this](https://www.parents.com/baby-names-ruined-by-technology-and-society-8656098 "According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), the baby name Alexa peaked as the 32nd most popular girlâ€™s name in 2015, before plummeting to rank 603. Why? Having Alexa as a trigger for a voice command around the house can lead to children with that name becoming the butt of jokes and bullying.") in the years prior.
- Siri. Would probably been liked had it worked.

Then came LLM chatbots. They talked like humans! Of course they need a ostensibly human name!
