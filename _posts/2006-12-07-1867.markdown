Music: Rufus Wainwright -- _Everybody Knows_

i'm drinking Over the Rhine blend coffee and it is tasty. medium roast w/o
hardly any acidity. i'm totally into this band coffee thing; i bought 2 lbs
without flinching. some music simply conjures the same good things that coffee
does...especially in the winter! i could totally see a Michael Miller blend
(similar to the OtR blend but somehow just more west coast), Rufus Wainwright
blend (much lighter and nuttier, maybe even a hint of fruitiness), Salim
Nourallah espresso (strong and bitter), Innocence Mission blend (pretty much
like the OtR blend, but from an Amish roaster, and included are recipies for
apple butter and funnel cake. and the bag has a quilt pattern on it).
