My friend Wood is the editor for [SCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Christian_Movement_of_Great_Britain)'s Movement magazine.

While I was visiting him last year (I think that's when it was), he asked me if I'd like to write for the magazine. Christians over there not generally being quite the strange bunch they are stateside, I agreed. The following is what resulted:

[The Antipocalypse](/writings/antipocalypse/)

I'm actually slated to do two more, and the request is I continue this thread. I have no idea how I'm going to do that, but I have three weeks to figure it out!
