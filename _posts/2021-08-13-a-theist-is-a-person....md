> An addict friend of mine said the day before, 'A theist is a person who has seen through the material and mechanical world and doesn't commit suicide.' I like this quote. To see that it is all bullshit and not to clock off, that requires faith. Only faith will do. Only faith. Even if you're double certain that there is nothing but space and dumb molecules out there, clattering about into symphonic and faraway futures, if you believe that's all there is and don't check out, you are hardcore. You must really love football or fucking or money or something and be okay with those things being only what they explicitly are, without implicit power, with no unravelling flag blowing behind them in limitless wind, back to before some unknowable moment of creation when this universe's heart first began to beat. 

Russel Brand, _Recovery_, p 110
