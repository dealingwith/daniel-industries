homeboy Jeffrey Gaines -- _Safety in Self_

> Now we must find a new safety in self  
> And implement all that we've learned  
> Now is the time to find our own wealth  
> And stand on our own So much we have grown  
> From knowing you
>  
> I know this loss was intended  
> To let us all begin  
> And to give up now would be a sin  
> We can't fall down  
> We've got to keep marching

_Just One Thing_

> I used to have a plan  
> Had one thing in my life that I could understand  
> But then I tried to have it all  
> And my one thing was the first to fall
>
> Now I go around place to place, town to town  
> Looking for just one thing  
> Now without a sound  
> Face to face in the crowd  
> I can't feel one thing
>  
> I used to be assured  
> Never in my life was I to be ignored  
> But I let it go to my head  
> All my lovers left me lying in a cold bed
