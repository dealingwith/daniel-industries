Maybe it's just because I listen to two episodes of Cal Newport's podcast a week, but it feels like there is a zeitgeist around slowing down, a rebellion against what Cal calls "the hyperactive hive mind", a sense that there is a critical mass asking, "Why?" in response to the typical knowledge worker's experience.

The two posts I've already written on this topic are ["Slow Flow"](https://daniel.industries/2021/04/24/slow-flow/) -- about the way the pandemic forced us into a slower, more contemplative space, particularly as it relates to our family lives -- and ["Lower your Standards"](https://daniel.industries/2021/09/24/lower-your-standards/) -- mostly quotes of a Ribbonfarm post, but where I end up riffing on an option of faith in a power greater than ourselves as a remedy to the fear that drives the hyperactive hive mind.

Cal's posts on the matter are, in order: ["On Slow Productivity and the Anti-Busyness Revolution"](On Slow Productivity and the Anti-Busyness Revolution) (April 7th) which I subconsciously ripped the title of, as I'd started this post prior to bringing up his post:

> My thinking in this area is still half-formed, but I've become increasingly convinced that what this conversation needs are alternative definitions of "productivity"; definitions that believably deliver on the promises of profitable value generation in businesses and resilient satisfaction in our personal lives, while rendering the excesses of overload culture as unnecessary at best, and profoundly harmful at worse...

> I don't know exactly what these new definitions of productivity might look like, but we can certainly do better than our current haphazard approaches, in which work descends into performative busyness on Slack, and our personal lives are digested into air-brushed social media moments. The human attraction toward some notion of productivity isnâ€™t the problem. The real issue is neglecting to figure out what specific notions actually make sense for our current moment.

["On Pace and Productivity"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/07/21/on-pace-and-productivity/) (July 21st)

> When it comes to pursuing deeper impact, however, perhaps sustainable success requires the embrace of a different and more forgiving timescale.

["What Would Happen If We Slowed Down?"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/09/07/what-would-happen-if-we-slowed-down/) (September 7th)

> Here's what I want to know: how much would this hurt you professionally? As I move deeper into my exploration of slow productivity, I'm starting to develop a sinking suspicion that the answer might be "not that much."

["A Pastor Embraces Slowness"](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/10/11/a-pastor-embraces-slowness/) (October 11th),
