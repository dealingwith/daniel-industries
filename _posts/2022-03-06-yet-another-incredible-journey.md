[Epic Games is acquiring music platform Bandcamp](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22958416/epic-games-bandcamp-music-store-acquisition)

I was (and still am) saddened by this news. I had always considered Bandcamp as one of those few companies that were committed to staying independent. They were profitable, as far as I know. They'd spent their first few years officing out of a public library (I can't find a reference to this anymore, but I have a distinct memory of this part of their story). I considered it a safe and principled place on which to host my music. I'd even recently (while job-hunting in November and December) applied to be a product manager there; at that moment it was my dream job.

[Our Incredible Journey](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/) already exists but it logs every industry acquisition. I decided to start logging only the most disappointing acquisitions: [Yet Another Incredible Journey on Notion](https://www.notion.so/dealingwith/Yet-Another-Incredible-Journey-2c562e74701f43e8a4d5220686c26090). I made it editable by anyone, so feel free to add to the list. There are some I skipped on purpose, notably YouTube, where it feels like the acquisition was a net positive for everyone. But my criteria was basically: 

1. could the company have continued without being acquired and 
2. have there been negative consequences (even just the further centralization of capital)
