> In every movie I watch from the '50s  
> There's only one thought that swirls  
> Around my head now  
> And that's that everyone there on the screen  
> Yeah, everyone there on the screen  
> Well, they're all dead now  
> They're all dead now

> Oh, these days it's so hard to relax  
> You gotta hold a gun to my back  
> To make me smile  
> To make me smile  
> And the only way I seem to cope  
> Is by trying to hold onto hope  
> If just for a while  
> If just for a while
