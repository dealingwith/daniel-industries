[Andy Hampsten and Marginal Gains](https://silca.cc/blogs/marginalgains/andy-hampsten-and-marginal-gains)

Andy Hampsten was, and still is, one of my favorite professional bicycle racers of all time. This Silca podcast episode featuring Andy is one of my favorite podcasts ever. I'm biased, but I feel like it would be interesting even to non-cyclists. Embedded below for archival purposes.

<p><img src="/assets/2022/04/D3h3sULU8AAgBeU.jpg" style="float:right;width:50%;margin:10px" />I've been obsessed with bicycle racing since middle school (although I did kind of tune out during the Lance years). In high school, my room was decorated with photos of professional cyclists, and professional cycling team caps (and, ok, a poster of Janet Jones on the back of the door). I specifically remember having this Graham Watson photo on the wall.</p>
