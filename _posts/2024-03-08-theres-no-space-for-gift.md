excerpt: "Now you have to go to work, and as I say, you have to wear their t-shirt, have to go on their retreats and have to smile all the time. It's like, not only are you alienated, you have to deny that you're alienated, which causes symptoms."

Peter Rollins on [Almost Heretical](https://almostheretical.com/peter-rollins/ "Peter Rollins: The Philosophy of Deconstruction - Almost Heretical"):

> You're supposed to like your job, which is horrific. Not only do you have to work for somebody, you have to like it. You have to wear their t-shirts...It's like, not only are you alienated, you have to deny that you're alienated, which causes symptoms.

> Because what is a symptom? A symptom tells the truth that you cannot tell yourself. So if you have to pretend that everything's great, the symptom explodes. And of course we're seeing the explosion of all these...I mean, fatigue is a very interesting modern symptom that you could say is a type of protest precisely against this weaving of everything into productivity. There's no space for gift.

<!-- When I [wrote 2023 in Review: Preface](/2024/01/01/2023-in-review-preface/ "With my first change of the new year, I unsubscribed from Cal Newport's podcast and Andrew Huberman's podcast. I'm slowly unsubscribing from some of my more productivity-related RSS feed subscriptions. I removed a bunch of the more manic productivity YouTube videos from my watch later playlist.") on the first of this year, I was maybe sensing something, a reconfiguring, some hint at the acknowledgement of all these symptoms (fatigue being primary among them) telling me a truth that I cannot tell myself. -->

I've still picked up and started Cal Newport's new book, _Slow Productivity_. He might be onto something, too. I need to finish this podcast and read that book, but I'm too busy trying to be productive.
