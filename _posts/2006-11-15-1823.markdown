[Salim Nourallah][1] is going through Beautiful Noise song-by-song and it's really good stuff....

In other news there is a squirrel living right above my head and it's somewhat annoying. It's dropping nuts onto the ceiling. But we're kind of building a relationship, he not unlike the elderly upstairs neighbor in an urban high-rise, cane scraping against the floor as he shuffles about his flat.
