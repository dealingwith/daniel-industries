I was writing some fiction for fun. Coming up with names is always a challenge for me, and it interrupts my flow especially when the name is just a mention in a passage I otherwise am ready to spill onto the page. So yes, I turned to my LLM robot friend.

I asked: "What's a good name for a masculine but dumb millennial? Like a rich, entitled frat bro who's in their 30s." (Apologies in advance if your name appears in its lists.)

It replied:

Here are some fun and fitting name ideas for a masculine, dumb-but-entitled millennial — think fratty energy, trust fund vibes, slightly behind on emotional development:

🧃 First Names (Peak Frat Bro)

These lean classic, vaguely upper-middle-class, and maybe a little too confident:
- Chad – The classic. You know what it is.
- Tanner – Tan. Buff. Always vaping.
- Bryce – Sounds like someone who overuses “bro” and owns NFTs.
- Trey – Probably the third. Probably drinks Red Bull at weddings.
- Blake – Confident and deeply confused.
- Brad – Slightly washed, clings to his college glory days.
- Brody – Lives at a permanent 15° backward tilt.
- Logan – Thinks he’s deep now that he read _The Alchemist_.
- Hunter – Wears salmon-colored shorts unironically.
- Zane – Spiked seltzer personified.

💸 Last Names (Rich-Guy Energy)

These help sell the entitled/trust-fund vibe:
- Van Wexler
- Carrington
- Bancroft
- Delamere
- Kingsley
- Wetherby
- Sutcliffe
- Ainsworth

🔥 Full Name Ideas
- Chad Bancroft – Smells like boat shoes and self-importance.
- Trey Carrington III – Calls his dad “Big T.”
- Blake Van Wexler – Doesn’t tip, but says “bless you” to the bartender.
- Zane Ainsworth – Dated a life coach once, still quotes her.
- Hunter Wetherby – Got into crypto “early” (late).
