> I have anxiety as sometimes I have depression, and I said to my family---you can't have this conversation with people---I said to them, it was during the hurricane and I was having a tough time thinking about about all the places I love and people I love in Florida and I was like, "Just so you guys know...I'm just having a a little bit of depression right now, I think it's situational, it's not going to be a big deal, it'll go away." ...and when you say you have a little anxiety what do people say? [In a voice] "What are you anxious about?"
