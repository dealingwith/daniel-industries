This is one my best lifelong friends. We don't get to talk much since I moved from SoFL and then he moved to PDX. Discovering this brought me great joy.

Scott is referenced directly in [the very first post on this blog](/2001/09/19/1/). He was the first reader, he was the first person invested in this thing I was doing to communicate with the broader world, to capture research and thoughts, to just _write_. He was the one that emailed me when I published the first paragraph of [Micha's Story](/writings/michas-story/) -- it might have been the first 2-4 paragraphs, I can't remember, I've since removed the individual posts and there's a little intro now too -- he said: "This is the best thing you've ever written," and I've collected emotional interest on that one sentence ever since.
