See _[Small Cypress on the Meaning of Life](/2026/01/15/small-cypress-on-the-meaning-of-life/)_, where I mention that _it rings so true, I might find this quote sufficient_. But they encouraged me in a Mastodon reply, _I think you should do this carnival_ ...and [here is the host's original post](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/2026-01-indieweb-carnival/) teeing up this month's prompt

### 01

One of my first thoughts when considering how to address this topic was: _it's right there in the tagline_, since nearly [the very beginning](https://web.archive.org/web/20020721133828/http://www.danielsjourney.com/)...

> seeking stories beauty meaning

Or, in the era-appropriate syntax of the 00s...

<aside markdown="1">
seeking :: stories :: beauty :: meaning
</aside>

It's the one thing from this site that has held up over the decades.

### 02

> love was a reasonable answer to this meaning-of-life business...I’m part of a greater mystery

A common theme here is this, but also that [my desire is to connect to that mystery via deep connections with specific people](/2007/07/16/confluence-or-this-is-pretty-much-the-exact-opposite-of-my-experience/ "love as existing entirely outside of emotion or love without a specific human signifier [does not] appeal to me very much...[I] desire for that human signifier who will not eradicate the radical lack, but perhaps occupy it with [me]"). Earlier in life I primarily tried to actualize this via romantic relationships, but as I've aged the idea and connotation of _romantic_ has changed. People, even those closest to you, tend to embody that greater mystery. And that can be frustrating. Ideally, it is [enjoyably frustrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jouissance "Jouissance, which manages to defy meaning, but a kind of excessive, transgressive enjoyment that goes beyond mere pleasure"). [[1](/2007/07/02/qotd-5/ "Only a saint in his asceticism might find jouissance that is not linked to the big Other. But there are no gallery openings for a saint’s performance.")] 

I recently revisited a longer-form piece I worked on in 2004 but never finished or fully published. Pieces of it can be found in: _[In the End, to Live a Perfect Life Is to Stop Being Human](/2007/01/30/when-i-am-dead-which-given-the-mood-i-am-in-and-the-unkempt-quality-of-my-hair-will-be-very-soon/)_, _[Sometimes You Just Have to Jump...](/2006/02/11/2515/)_, _[Doors](/2004/05/30/Doors/)_, _[My Life: Vows](/2004/02/27/Fiction-My-Life-Vows-draft-bit/)_, _[My Life: Night Draft Bit](/2004/02/27/Fiction-My-Life-Night-draft-bit/)_.

As with many old works, reading it is dubious and disquieting. From above, you can see that I originally published fragments under the title _My Life_, then as selections disconnected from the larger work, which is thinly veiled stories from my divorce era intertwined with some of the most transgressive fiction I've written.

But much of what I wrote in the above posts, the newest of which is 19 years old, still rings true, and speaks to my answer to this never answered question of meaning.

**To feel connected**
</aside>

Maybe that's through a prayer, or a song, or a partner, or a stranger. Maybe that can be described as _love_. It is, at best, elusive.

### 03

As is the nature of our attention, I discovered some relevant things since turning mine to this topic.

📺 [The Ballad of Clem Snide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBfjxYhj8a0). If you have not listened to the music of [Eef Barzelay/Clem Snide](https://www.clemsni.de) [[Bandcamp](https://clem-snide.bandcamp.com/)/[Bandcamp](https://eefbarzelay-clemsnide.bandcamp.com/)/[Bandcamp](https://clemsnideband.bandcamp.com/)] yet, you are in for a treat. I can easily claim he is my top five favorite lyricists. Much of what he says in this mini documentary feels like a great sermon at [my new church](/writings/my-new-church/#three) (or in this case, synagogue). If you don't know where to start, a few of my favorites are 📻 [Misty](https://eefbarzelay-clemsnide.bandcamp.com/track/misty-2), 📻 [Forever Just Beyond](https://clemsnideband.bandcamp.com/track/forever-just-beyond) (with Scott Avett), and 📻 [The Ballad Of God's Love](https://eefbarzelay-clemsnide.bandcamp.com/track/the-ballad-of-gods-love).

📺 [The Innocence Mission Tiny Desk Concert](https://youtu.be/_RT5tZtCAD0) from 2018. The Innocence Mission was the soundtrack of that era I referenced above, and _Tomorrow On The Runway_ is listed as soundtrack to _[Doors](/2004/05/30/Doors/)_, and also the second song of this Tiny Desk performance. 📻 A wonderful cover of this song was [recorded by Trespassers William](https://saintmarierecords.bandcamp.com/track/tomorrow-on-the-runway-2). 

📺 That led me to [Iron & Wine's beautiful cover](https://youtu.be/P_HKzT99kVg) of it. Not many people would dare to cover the Innocence Mission. 📻 [I dared to copy their cover of John Denver](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/follow-me) but recruited one of the best singers I know for it. 📻 [Here is their original cover](https://theinnocencemission.bandcamp.com/track/follow-me) (_original cover_ is a funny neologism).

That reminds me of the other great cover of an Innocence Mission song, Sufjan Steven's rendition of _Lakes of Canada_, 📺 [performed live on a Cincinnati rooftop in 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uceNZtKZAnc) or 📻 [another live recording with slightly better fidelity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF7OjN6qBQA). 📻 [Here is the original](https://theinnocencemission.bandcamp.com/track/the-lakes-of-canada). They did another recording in 2019 that is available as a free download: 📻 [the lakes of canada 2019](https://theinnocencemission.bandcamp.com/track/the-lakes-of-canada-2019). I discovered (many) more covers while searching Bandcamp, those by 📻 [FAUXKNOW](https://fauxknow.bandcamp.com/track/lakes-of-canada) and 📻 [Honeysuckle](https://honeysuckleband.bandcamp.com/track/lakes-of-canada-innocence-mission) stood out.

Do you ever think about how, before recording technologies, _covers_ were the only way to listen to music?

📚 [Eventually Everything Connects: Eight Essays on Uncertainty By Sarah Firth](https://www.graphicmundi.org/books/978-1-63779-068-7.html). I have been reading this off and on for a long time but can already recommend it.

### 04

Music appears to be one of the strongest of the invisible connective tissues of the universe. While I'm here, I've already posted about it twice, but as always the latest edition of [Midnight Radio](https://www.jamesreeves.co/radio/), _[Darkly Euphoric](https://www.jamesreeves.co/darkly-euphoric/)_, is perfect.

> ...a startup that “develops sophisticated autonomous AI agents that can make intelligent decisions with minimal human intervention”--even though human intervention is the whole fucking point of being on this planet...

### PS

Today I attended [Homebrew Website Club - Writing Edition](https://events.indieweb.org/2026/01/homebrew-website-club-writing-edition-vXocJMdNFV18), having found out via [Tracy Durnell's Weeknotes](https://tracydurnell.com/2026/01/16/weeknotes-jan-10-16-2026/), and it was delightful, perhaps even magical. A moment of connection during what has been a [season of isolation](/2026/01/10/how-to-horribly-end-a-year/).
