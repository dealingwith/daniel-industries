In a welcome relief from real life, there is a great show tonight at the Gypsy Tea Room. Three great reasons to attend:

1. <a href="http://salimnourallah.com/">Salim Nourallah</a> is an amazing musician and local legend.
2. Maktub, from Seattle, includes <a href="http://www.danielspils.com/">Daniel Spils</a>, part of the Robot Co-op, makers of 43 Things, and one of his goals is to meet 43 Things users while on tour.
3. It's Ryan's birthday / going away party. Ryan runs a lot of the show at both Landmark Theaters here in Dallas and from what I understand he's moving to Chicago to open a new Landmark there.

Update: So it turns out Maktub is really good. See this band whenever you have the chance. Bad turnout tonight in Dallas but they still rocked for at least an hour and a half...great tunes, great mix, great stage presence...they have it all. I also was able to talk to Daniel Spils before and after the show...until the GTR people kicked everyone out at 12:45...WTF?
