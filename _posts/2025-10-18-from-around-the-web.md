This is mostly an excuse to say I've tweaked the design of the site a little bit and I'm happy with said tweaks. There may be more tweaks coming but time has been scarce as of late so I need to put a bow on this little iteration.

### The best podcast and it's not even close

It's [Imaginary Advice](https://www.imaginaryadvice.com/). Go listen. I can't recommend a particular episode over another. I've been texting episodes to friends for months.

Never Post made my [2024 in Review](/2025/01/04/2024-in-review/#culture-and-stuff), but their latest, [A.I. and New American Fascism](https://www.neverpo.st/a-i-and-new-american-fascism/), is excellent.

Heck, while we're here: [How to Host a Strategy Offsite](https://www.foxwizard.com/e9/) by Foxwizard, who I have mentioned three times already so will not link back to them all here. Particularly the first half.

### Art

Conspiracy of Cartographers's [Petrofuture Gallery](https://conspiracyofcartographers.com/petrofuturegallery/).

> The Petrofuture series is an attempt to re-imagine our memories, to alter the tropes of our nostalgia. By re-branding, re-titling, and editing the maps to show the maximum level of sea rise when the ice caps melt, these maps take on the promotions of petro-corporations and turn them back on themselves, depicting the ultimate consequences of car culture and fossil fuels.

Spoiler alert: Florida and Delaware are gone; South Carolina, Jersey, and Virginia do not fare well; Boston, New York, and DC are toast. Or rather, submerged.

[This random YouTube with Ethan Hawke nerding out about music](https://youtu.be/nWQjJPHuNSU), including a great Kris Kristofferson impersonation, confirming my long-standing fandom of Ethan Hawke.

### Web stuff

[barnsworthburning](https://barnsworthburning.net/) has been my favorite personal website since I discovered it about a month ago. I tore through [the code](https://github.com/Aias/barnsworthburning) that weekend--I had Claude Code write me a 1400 line document about different approaches to refactoring its data source, which is Airtable as written by the author. Except he is working on a "[spiritual successor](https://github.com/Aias/red-cliff-record)" to it already that appears to be geared towards general use.
