I do not know how or why it arrived. Obviously everything is terrible. Here are some hypotheses, in order of my confidence in their likelihood as an over/under percentage:

üíä I took my vitamins. But I often take my vitamins. 1%

üíä I specifically took my magnesium. I had run out and missed a few days, then started back up on my nightly regimen. 3%

üö¥ I rode my bicycle. I hadn't ridden much because of the very cold weather here. But I had ridden some, and I wasn't enjoying it. Then, suddenly, I was again. 5%

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Magic. Someone prayed for me just right. Someone said some magic incantation in my presence. It was just my time, God booped me on the head. I don't really thinks this is the way things work, but I'm open to it. If God sent me a telegram that said, YEP IT WAS ME STOP SOMETIMES I JUST DO STUFF LIKE THAT STOP, I'd shrug and think, "Well I'll be." 10%

üóØÔ∏è I stopped checking social media so often. I didn't decide to, it just happened. I'd get to the end of a day and realize I'd barely opened Mastodon. And I still wouldn't have much drive to open it then. Things just got to be too much. Too much hand-ringing, too much crazy stuff all at once, too much _OMFG can you believe they're doing *that*_. Not enough good stuff in-between. Not enough art, not enough action. It still feels like this is a byproduct of the hope, though, even if self-reinforcing. 35%

üíÄ Things got so bad that I accidentally practiced a _[futurorum malorum pr√¶meditatio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_visualization)_, the Stoic practice of imagining the worst that could happen. I hit bottom, in 12 Step parlance. I came to believe I was powerless over..._the amorphous mob of hate and vile, and the powers that ascended from them_.

There were a lot of scenarios that ran through my head, but they all resulted in, "...and then we'll deal with that," or, "...and then we'll all find out what life is like after that." I realized that when it came to the crumbling of our society, government, and economy, that the worse it got, the more we'd all be in it together. 

This had additional unexpected side-effects. I compared myself less to other people more well off than me, or more talented, or more put together. Small frustrations or inconveniences stopped being antagonistic vexations of an angry universe determined to thwart me. I was more grateful for little things; one day while I cleaned my kitchen countertop I actually thought to myself, "I like this house so much, I should going to enjoy it now, it is so much better than a tent." I realized that some sad middle-of-the-road outcome from all this nonsense might feel less satisfying: no real change, just nagging awfulness and bile and bad feelings, still in our trances. If things got bad enough, maybe, just maybe, we'd change things. 60%

üï≥Ô∏è This might be a superset of the above, but I decided I was an optimistic nihilist. I realized I didn't just invent that idea, and after searching for and finding tons of videos and articles, I'm starting to think I am practicing a particular edge or nuanced version. I do believe in a Great Other, something mysterious and elusive that is embodied in all living things and maybe even in every molecule and atom, connecting everything, whispering, prompting, urging. I don't believe that in the end will be _absolutely_ nothing. I'd watched this video a few times, and realized that it was very much in line with his 3rd concept, _A place between everything & nothing_...

I don't know if I agree with his final conclusion, that optimism is a choice. Becoming an alcoholic is the combination of thousands of choices, and eventually getting sober stops being a choice. 60%

üéà I decided that while I do not believe in a "God of coincidences", I like to look for opportunities to practice _divine nonchalance_. I first learned of this idea the first time I watched [The Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Institute_(2013_film)) many years ago. Based on my recent searches, it has been adopted mostly by new-age types or mentioned in press about [Dispatches from Elsewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatches_from_Elsewhere), the fictional adaptation of the events described in The Institute. "Divine nonchalance refers to a state of relaxed confidence and trust in the universe, allowing one to let go of worries and embrace life with a childlike wonder. It encourages living in the moment and accepting outcomes without excessive attachment or anxiety," says an AI summary in my search results. That works. _Accepting outcomes._ I once heard someone in an AA meeting say, "I got out of the outcomes business," and I thought I was on board, but I didn't really _feel_ any different. Something about hitting bottom, realizing I was powerless, and the sense that the end of the world as we know it was coming and I felt fine. 65%

Here are some cool things I've found that have helped me stay optimistic.
