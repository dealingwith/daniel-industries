In a related vein, I continue to find unbelievably spiritual experiences in unexpected places...

Tonight we hung out at a medium sized Bosnian gathering in a private home. We were immediately received with great warmth. Food, spirits, and music were all in ample supply. The atmosphere was unmatched. It is really hard to do the night justice in words.

I had the thought...this is the kind of experience that Americans find maybe 10% of in church meetings, and then in programmed, sterilized formats. Tonight was a spontaneous, authentic experience with real people who have experienced true hardship and still give all of themselves to you.

I experienced confusion about how this culture (former Yugoslavia) could have produced the kind of war that they did...and then you realize that the culture producers were the victims, and yet were the most victorious. Victorious in their desire for peace and their constant choice to Live in the face and constant threat of death.
