Announcing Open Office Hours, every Tuesday and Thursday 9am-6pm...feel free to come by my place to cozy up to some wifi and coffee and kick some coworking arse together. I likely won't be chatty, but your presence will be appreciated for its implicit accountability. Smoking lounge and doggie day care out back and possibility of a random home cooked meal by another of your coworkers.

Email me if you are interested but do not yet know where I live.

RSVP with your hours if you want to assure desk space available when you arrive...but either way we will accommodate you.
