[Melodica Festival Self-Indulgent, But Still Positive for Dallas][1], especially the comments [2024 update: comments are gone]. 

<a class="dead">This too</a> [2024 update: weshotjr.com link is dead. It was a fantastic music blog back in the day.] ESPESH the comments OMGBBQ.

I think the main thing everyone is missing is: damn if this new music editor isn't a uniter.

Recently revisiting _Immediatism_ flavors my reading of all this. I was about to post part _iii_ as my comment on the actual article, except it doesn't make sense unless you automatically replace [Wuffie][4] for _Capital_ like I did.

> For art, the intervention of Wuffie always signals a further degree of mediation. To say that art is wuffified is to say that a mediation, or standing-inbetween, has occurred, & that this betweenness amounts to a split, & that this split amounts to "alienation."

There is so much in my head around art right now, but it's too disjointed. Crazy good book coming 2018.
