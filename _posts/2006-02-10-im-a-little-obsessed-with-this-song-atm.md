_Nobody Gets a Smooth Ride_ (S.Hindalong, T.Chandler)

Nobody gets a smooth ride  
Every child will learn  
How the asphalt burns  
When he takes a sharp turn too wide  
Nobody gets a smooth ride

I’m really sorry the way things are going these days  
Try to be careful that’s all I can say  
I’m really sorry the way things are going

Civilians needn’t wear guns  
Bullets rain on us  
The hapless populace  
Fools will shoot the sky just for fun  
Civilians needn’t wear guns

I’m really sorry the way things are going these days  
Try to be careful that’s all I can say  
I’m really sorry the way things are going

High flyers oughta use nets  
Hold on tight to the bar  
Circus trapeze star  
What a shame should you fall to your death  
High flyers oughta use nets

I’m really sorry the way things are going  
Nobody gets a smooth ride
