[Silicon Valley Product Group -- 40 Years In Tech](https://svpg.com/40-years-in-tech/)

> One of the things I’ve found is that learning and experience truly are cumulative.  The more I learn, the more I’m able to contextualize new information, and make sense out of more complicated situations.

> It’s remarkable how your depth of understanding of topics can continue to improve over time, when you make the effort to listen, to think and especially to write.

> Some habits you develop early in your career pay dividends over time, such as being a lifelong learner, an active reader, and an aspiring writer...

> Today I’m much better at interviewing people and predicting who will succeed in a given role.

> I’m much better at picking my battles as to which behaviors in a company are serious issues, and which really don’t matter. 

> I’m also much better not just at answering questions, but in perceiving the context behind the questions.

> I’m much better at predicting which products and companies will do well, and which will likely fade away.

> And I’m definitely better at knowing what I can’t know, and admitting what I don’t know.

I only have a little over half as much time in the industry as Marty Cagan but I related to these passages in particular.

Another great newsletter is [This Beautiful Mess](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) by John Cutler. In his most recent issue he proposes these questions product leaders should be asking:

> Does the team connect directly with customers? Or is information about customers relayed through a chain of filters?

> Does the team think about done in terms of customer impact? Or is the team done when code shows up in production and nothing explodes?

> Does the team have detailed strategic context? Or a watered down version of the strategy?

> Does the team focus on a metric (or a set of metrics) that measures the efficacy of the product strategy? Or does the organization focus on a high-level metric like Daily Active Users?

> Does the organization consider the drivers of sustainable, differentiated growth? Or is everyone focused on something like near-term revenue?

> Do team members trust each other?
