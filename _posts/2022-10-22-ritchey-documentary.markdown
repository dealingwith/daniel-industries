The documentary on Tom Ritchey -- _Ritchey - Icon & Pioneer_ -- on [GCN+](https://welcome.globalcyclingnetwork.com/) is almost worth the price of admission by itself.

It made me think of Cal Newport's [Lifestyle-Centric Career Planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/05/21/the-most-important-piece-of-career-advice-you-probably-never-heard/) concept. Tom Ritchey might be one of the premier examples of it, without ever having known about it and in fact practicing it over 30 years before even Cal's original post in 2008.

Many of Cal's recent podcast episodes talk about Lifestyle-Centric Career Planning, but [the most recent one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk) spends quite a bit of time at it at the beginning and in answering the first Q&A.
