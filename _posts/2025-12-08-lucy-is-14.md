Lucy, [that Lucy](/2011/12/15/lucy-pearl/), [this Lucy](/2013/03/13/lucy-14-months/), is 14.

For her birthday, she wanted to go to the "family farm", aka the country house/cabin in Oklahoma on property first owned by my grandfather and now owned by my uncle. She brought her friend, Milo brought his friend, the 4-hour drive up there on Friday felt like 8 for no particular reason but probably because it got dark so soon after we left Dallas. More family arrived Saturday and celebrations were had. There was a lot of jungle ball played. There was a birthday cake baked by Lucy and her friend. There were many fish caught and released by Milo and his friend. There were rides in the Ranger (a side-by-side) around the property. It was very cold outside and very warm in all our hearts. Our cats were happy to see us when we got back Sunday.
