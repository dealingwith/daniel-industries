Which unfortunately also equates to how I feel both mentally and physically. I've got an annoying cold, the kind that doesn't knock you out so much that you _can't_ do anything, but enough so much that you don't _want_ to do anything. I did manage to move a piano--_to my house_--this morning and am going to a show tonight, but in-between-times? Not so much. I miss someone to talk with, someone to lay around with. Someone in particular.

Duke Special -- _John Lennon Love_, from the free EP ~~you can download here~~.

Olospo -- _You Deserve Better_ from the Zac Crain benefit CD. I've been really into this song lately and emailed Chris Holt about getting ahold of more Olospo. He gave me the scoop on the band which I put on his last.fm page.
