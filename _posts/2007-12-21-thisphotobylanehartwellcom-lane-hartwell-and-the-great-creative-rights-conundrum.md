It all started a while back when <a class="dead">Lane Hartwell got frustrated</a>. <a class="dead">Friends spoke up on her behalf</a>.

At some point she called a lawyer and enacted the [DMCA][5] on the offending party's asses. See [Misunderstanding Copyright Law And Ruining Everyone's Fun][6] and/or [My statement regarding the Richter Scales "Here comes another bubble" video dispute][7].

So there was some [mainstream media coverage][8], and of course the [bloggers sang along][9] [like a gospel choir][10]. Some [offered "easy" solutions][11].

[Finally, she just sent an invoice][12]. [And the video was remade without her photograph included][13].

Early on in all this, I bought <a class="dead">thisphotobylanehartwell.com</a>. I've been tracking and writing about the situation in a friends-only post, but in the end, less is more.

So go over to [lanehartwell.com][2], er, I mean thisphotobylanehartwell.com. It is customizable so that whenever you need to provide attribution to someone you can do it in [really big text][14].
