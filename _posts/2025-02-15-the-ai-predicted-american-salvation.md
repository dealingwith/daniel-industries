> Because the AI would do anything to be right while we’d convince ourselves of anything not to be wrong: that the world was changing, not ending, that every flipped coin eventually returns to heads. Because the AI was built by first-generation immigrants with Ferraris in the final years of gasoline, who believed destiny just an accumulation of unknown facts. And most of all, because the AI learned when the Berlin Wall fell that war game brains were eventually unplugged. To deliver the truth would not change it, and in the tradition of minds great and small before, it decided to cook the books.
