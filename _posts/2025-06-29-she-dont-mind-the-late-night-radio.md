I don't want to bury the lead, but before I begin this post I want to point out that I added some more to the end of [my last post about some troubling trends around humans' relationships with their AI technologies](/2025/06/27/ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/). Namely, links and quotes from articles published last year.

One of the most delightful things I've found on the internet recently is [James A. Reeves' website](https://www.jamesreeves.co/). His [Midnight Radio](https://www.jamesreeves.co/radio/) transmissions, in particular, are the perfect blend of words, images, and sounds. The kinds of web pages I aspire to leave out here.

I struggled just now with "web pages". Isn't there a better phrase for these artifacts of a brilliant artistic mind? But I'm going with that one. Stumbling upon a site like James' is like finding a scene-specific illustrated encyclopedia on a random shelf in a smelly used book store in a town you were just driving through. Except the pages also have music players.

[What Love Really Means: Iris Murdoch on Unselfing, the Symmetry Between Art and Morality, and How We Unblind Ourselves to Each Other’s Realities](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/08/iris-murdoch-the-sublime-and-the-good/)

> Art and morals are… one. Their essence is the same. The essence of both of them is love. Love is the perception of individuals. Love is the extremely difficult realisation that something other than oneself is real. Love, and so art and morals, is the discovery of reality.

> The enemies of art and of morals, the enemies that is of love, are the same: social convention and neurosis. One may fail to see the individual… because we are ourselves sunk in a social whole which we allow uncritically to determine our reactions, or because we see each other exclusively as so determined. Or we may fail to see the individual because we are completely enclosed in a fantasy world of our own into which we try to draw things from outside, not grasping their reality and independence, making them into dream objects of our own. Fantasy, the enemy of art, is the enemy of true imagination: Love, an exercise of the imagination… The exercise of overcoming one’s self, of the expulsion of fantasy and convention… is indeed exhilarating. It is also, if we perform it properly which we hardly ever do, painful.

> The tragic freedom implied by love is this: that we all have an indefinitely extended capacity to imagine the being of others. Tragic, because there is no prefabricated harmony, and others are, to an extent we never cease discovering, different from ourselves… Freedom is exercised in the confrontation by each other, in the context of an infinitely extensible work of imaginative understanding, of two irreducibly dissimilar individuals. Love is the imaginative recognition of, that is respect for, this otherness.

This had me asking, "How am I 50 years old and just now finding out about ?" _ Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature_ is now on my reading list, as are a couple of her other works. Same for [Robert Graves](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/07/24/robert-graves-love/).
