Lauryn Hill, _Father Forgive Them_, _I Used to Love Him_.

Poe, _Haunted_, _Control_.

Poe is a very interesting cat. She's apparently just come out of a long legal battle with her record label and is doing the independent thing. I think she is a precedent-setter, and I think we will see more small-but-big-enough-to-have-a-go-of-it acts following suit. The kind of acts you will see succeed are the ones with their own authentic ethos, the kind of something that retains fans, connects with them on a deeper level, keeps them coming out to shows and buying discs even when the market is weak and over-saturated.

To describe what she went through, and also as a condemnation on the industry as a whole, [Poe wrote a story](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014224539/http://www.realpoe.com/gallery/ramblings/thepsycho.htm). It is really good, I recommend reading it through.

Poe is the one who is [Danielewski](https://www.markzdanielewski.com/)'s sister (of course we all heard of Poe first with her 1995 hit, whatever it was!), and her last record, _Haunted_, is a concept album around _House of Leaves_ (as well as dealing with [her father](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199756/)'s death...a soundbyte from him at the end of _Control_ is amazing). 

In fact, they went on tour together, a combo book/music tour. Found some pictures from that today.
