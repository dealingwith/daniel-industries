Lauryn Hill, _Father Forgive Them_, _I Used to Love Him_.

Poe, _Haunted_, _Control_.

Poe is a very interesting (and beautiful) cat. She's apparently just come out of a long legal battle with her record label and is doing the independent thing. I think she is a precedent-setter, and I think we will see more small-but-big-enough-to-have-a-go-of-it acts following suit. The kind of acts you will see succeed are the ones with their own authentic ethos, the kind of something that retains fans, connects with them on a deeper level, keeps them coming out to shows and buying discs even when the market is weak and over-saturated.

To describe what she went through, and also as a condemnation on the industry as a whole, <a href="/the-psycho">Poe wrote a story</a>. It is really good, I recommend reading it through.

Poe is the one who is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375703764/qid=1070607305/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-0762212-5100949">Danielewski's</a> sister (of course we all heard of Poe first with her 1995 hit, whatever it was!), and her last record, Haunted, is a concept album around House of Leaves (as well as dealing with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199756/">her father's</a> death...a soundbyte from him at the end of <em>Control</em> is amazing). 

In fact, they went on tour together, a combo book/music tour. Found more pictures from that today, <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/08.html">here</a> (more Mark), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/11.html">here</a> (Mark with a venti Starbucks), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/16.html">here</a> (Mark and Poe at the public library), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/17.html">here</a> (backstage at Jay Leno, Mark is looking <em>tre cool</em> but I don't think he was actually on the show, must just have been his Hollywood look), and <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/14.html">here</a> (this guy read, from memory we presume, the entire HoL quote from the special version of <em>Hey Pretty</em> {that we only found at Salon back when we were reading the book}{from a search of my archives, I apparently never blogged about the book or those files, despite a memory for doing just such}{the one where Mark reads from the book in between sections of the song}, during a Poe concert!). Lots more good pics and stories if you surf around there a bit. Poe's <a href="http://starfileonline.com/lrgoutput/PoeXX031017R307.jpg">looking darn good these days</a> and even <a href="http://starfileonline.com/lrgoutput/PoeXX031017R306.jpg">has some ninja moves</a>.
