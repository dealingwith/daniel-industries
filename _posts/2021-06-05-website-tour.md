I was invited to do a "[website tour](https://hyperlink.academy/events/208)", to basically give a history of the structure and technology behind this site, for Hyperlink Academy. I thought it went pretty well, although I couldn't stand to re-listen (I didn't re-watch) to it for a while. When I did, I realized the host's background noise during the first third or so of the talk is really distracting. I created a version that crops off that first third. 

If you want to watch the entire thing, use [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXXtx5Lip4Q).

If you want to just listen to the parts after the background noise subsides, use [this mp3 link]({{site.url}}/assets/2021/06/Website-Tour-Daniel-Miller.mp3).
