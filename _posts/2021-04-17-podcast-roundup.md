There have been a lot fewer of these types of posts since the pandemic (and now a remote job) removed my need to drive an hour every day. But my vaccine appointments were two hours away in Paris, TX, so I set my podcasting app to play at 1.2x and cranked through some interesting episodes.

[Lex Fridman Podcast #166 â€“ Cal Newport: Deep Work, Focus, Productivity, Email, and Social Media](https://lexfridman.com/cal-newport/)

The unexpected favorite was this Lex Fridman podcast. I'd never heard of this podcast before, but since I'm a huge Cal Newport fan, when this episode crossed my desk I queued it up. It's very long but I particularly liked the end. Lex has a YouTube channel with just clips from his podcasts, which is great. He didn't create a clip for that end portion, but this was another good one:

[Bobby and Jens with bikepacking legend James Hayden](https://soundcloud.com/bobbyandjens/james-hayden)

The farthest I've ever ridden was [114.9 miles nine years ago](https://www.strava.com/activities/34296639). A shorter race for [James Hayden](https://www.jamesmarkhayden.uk) is something like [317.3 mostly offroad miles in just over a day](https://ridewithgps.com/trips/55021895). It's bananas. They get into all the details on this great episode of Bobby and Jens.
