I've already talked about Salim Nourallah on this blog, [here](/2019/05/05/salim-retrospective/), [here](/2005/05/19/Tonight-Maktub-and-Salim-Nourallah-at-the-Gypsy-Tea-Room/), a brief mention in [this 2006 SXSW daily recap post](/2006/03/18/sx-update-12/) (which I just rediscovered and I have no memory of getting to talk with Sarah Hepola), and then the [next day's recap](/2006/03/19/goodbye-austin-for-now/) (which I am so pleased to have rediscovered, because I do remember all of that, and it was _incredible_...those were the days), [here](/2018/10/29/listening-rooms/), [here](/2022/04/11/a-break-in-the-battle/), and many other posts about my [own studio projects](/music) at [Pleasantry Lane Studio](http://www.pleasantrylane.com/).

The other day I noticed [Merlin Mann](https://mastodon.social/@hotdogsladies) post a "[A Gentle Introduction to the Old 97's](https://mastodon.social/@hotdogsladies/111610678682252111)", surprised an internet-famous known-music-connoisseur would be into a Dallas Americana band. I wondered if any of [the Salim-produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Nourallah#Producer) tracks were on the playlist. The last one was.

I've created "[1978 - A Gentle Introduction to Salim Nourallah](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3SsC5E8ew3fDP1xJBHWKBQ?si=b50b5dc304fc4cf8)" in the 7-song style of Merlin's playlists. It was difficult to decide on what seven songs from Salim's extensive catalog to include. I included the song I wrote, _This Town_, because of course I had to, even though it shouldn't probably make the cut.
