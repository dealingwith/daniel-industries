Went to the <a href="http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com/main.html">The Polyphonic Spree</a> record release at <a href="http://goodrecords.com/">Good Records</a>. Bits:

Family Hughes getting the very first signings, <a class="dead">literally</a>.

Good mexican food and free beer! And free Monster to keep you up all night.

I had this short conversation with the drummer [paraphrased]:

"Listen to the record," he instructs me.

"Actually, I have been," I inform him.

"Oh," he surprises.

"A friend hooked me up with it a few weeks ago."

Look of irritation and subtle confusion: "Where'd he get it?"

"I don't know, from a friend who always has everything. The original source is unknown."

More irritation, possible pissy-ness [me realizing maybe I shouldn't have said anything], something like, "Yeah you never know with these things."

"But I came and got the actual artifact!" holding up signed CD leaf dramatically.

"That's a good thing!" somewhat condescendingly.

"But you're what? A 23-member band now? At 15 bucks, even <em>if</em> you got all the money from it, that's less than a buck a person. That's harsh!"

"Yeah..." trailing out and looking dejected.

"I felt like I should have just come here, gone down the line and given everybody a couple bucks."

Look of astonishment. Me realizing I shouldn't go into the whole rethinking-distribution tirade of <a class="dead">Integration Research</a>. Move on to next person.
