Last night we went to see [A Break in the Battle](https://abreakinthebattle.bandcamp.com/), a covers project by [Salim Nourallah](/2019/05/05/salim-retrospective/), [Chris Holt](/2010/11/21/chris/), and [Paul Averitt](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/life-in-a-dangerous-time). There is something about being among one's people again that is comforting. Beyond the music itself, and it was excellent, something about the evening made me ok with being in my current stage of life. I'm not making music myself and haven't in nearly a decade. I have kids in various stages of life. I have a very full-time job. I'm in middle age. And that's ok. For the most part.
