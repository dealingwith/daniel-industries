> why does the thought of revival scare me? isn't it what christians are supposed to be praying for, that our society should turn to god? the problem is, all the images in my head are creepy. religious mania. weeping and wailing in the streets. censorship. rigidity and punishment. zealous preachers. fear god and cast out the sinners. enforced niceness.

> how come 'revival' never means good coffee and free wifi, everywhere? really challenging and confrontational art? the development of cheap sustainable technology? an end to greed and overwork? a good wage for the [formerly] poor? what would a holy, as opposed to religious, society look like?
