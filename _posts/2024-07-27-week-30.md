## Weeknotes?

I haven't written a [weeknote](/categories/#weeknotes) in over 11 years, but the trend is making the rounds again, so even though this will almost certainly be a one-off, I am categorizing this post as such. It's the 30th week of the year. I broke out on my own last August. So 50-some weeks, and nary a weeknote.

Of consequence, the last time I was writing weeknotes was the last time I'd left a real job on purpose and struck out on my own, same as now. That time, I managed five updates. Despite their infrequency then, and their non-existence this time around, the similarities are stunning[^1].

[Week Three](/2012/12/18/week-three/)

> ...the business of the everyday continues to be both a burden and a blessing. I am getting to spend a lot more time with Lucy, which is amazing, and I constantly remind myself: that was the majority of the reason for this time. I have also managed to get some things done that had been festering in my inbox for months.

[Week Five](/2013/01/05/week-six/)

> ...there is a certain measure of cognitive dissonance, when the last weeks of Margot’s life are mostly a blur of pain and disbelief; and, well, all weeks with Lucy are so full of joy, laughter and happiness. I recently saw Penn playing with a three year-old and it was impossible not to imagine what it would be like to have Margot still here with us. But we don’t. We do have each other. And the four of us continue forward in a cloud of that grace and we will be grateful for every day it exists.

[Week Six](/2013/01/13/week-six/)

> But part of that for me is the return of paid work, possibly turning full time in as few as two weeks. This is a good thing, says my budget and bank account, which are tired from months of redness. But it makes me a little regretful for having not taken better advantage of this time for my own ends...
> 
> But then there is the reality of all the other things that need doing, from personal care like riding my bike and reading to family matters such as medical issues and home repairs. I’m preaching to the choir here I know.

[Weeks Ten and Eleven](/2013/02/17/weeks-ten-and-eleven/)

> I’m still trying to finish up and/or start some side projects, one of the best evidences of which is the fact I’m still titling these less-than-weekly minutial posts as weeknotes.
>
> The paid work has gotten in the way of the unpaid work, namely the new record, some bartered work, and the secret side project. But as long as the paid work is interesting, pleasant and, well, paid, I can’t very well complain now can I? Stress about money can ruin everything else and so it is best to assuage that stress as long as the work stress does not overwhelm it. And as I grow older I’m finding that the only people who achieve a work-life balance are those people who simply do not (or need not) worry about money, so until I’m at that point I’m happy with the amount of balance I am able to maintain.

[Big Week](/2013/04/12/big-week/)

> ...we shipped. And shipping is always good, if always a bit disappointing. There are always bugs that wait until after you’ve shipped to reveal themselves. This is particularly true when there isn’t a QA process in place but I think it’s true regardless.

## My 15 nanoseconds of fame

I was featured on _People & Blogs_ this week: [P&B: Daniel Miller](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-daniel-miller)

## This week is always a bittersweet one

Margot's birthday was Tuesday. She would have been 15. I don't write about this every year anymore. We have a new tradition of blowing out candles on a birthday cake, something we started two years ago: [Margot Would Have Been a Teenager Today](https://www.daniel.industries/2022/07/23/margot-would-have-been-a-teenager-today/)

## Changes come

Some good stuff has been stirring lately. 


[^1]: For many years now I have kept private notes of this nature, although, not intended for any audience, they tend to be more raw, less removed, and as a consequence, more dark and disturbing.
