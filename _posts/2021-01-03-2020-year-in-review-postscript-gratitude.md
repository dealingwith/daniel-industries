Despite this year being the unanimously voted Worst Year Ever, I personally have a lot to be grateful for. I'm normally the Eeyore type, willing to see the downside of any windfall, imagine an axe always ready to fall on my neck, attribute to luck every miracle. But in the last few days, I've been a little overcome with gratitude. It's disconcerting, to be honest.

Besides the things mentioned in the previous posts:

I got to ride my bike a lot more. I rode my bike 100 miles (at once) for the first time in about eight years.

We got a kitten.

My family has remained healthy. My children continue to be a delight, and smart, and happy. We just had a great Christmas morning, I got to go on a bike ride, and soon we'll eat Christmas dinner. It's just a little chilly outside and it's warm and cozy inside. There's a lot to be hopeful for as we enter 2021.
