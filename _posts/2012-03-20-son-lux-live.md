We interrupt the series in progress to bring you this important announcement: I just discovered a newish Son Lux live album, available at a you-name-it price on Bandcamp:

I wish there was a better way to say my mind was blown. [Flowers](http://music.sonluxmusic.com/track/flowers) was a song I couldn't listen to before (because the lyrics were too evocative); the live version somehow changes the song enough that I really enjoyed it (even though, obviously, the lyrics are the same). But the main thing that hit me about the live EP is that, if listened to with certain ears, it has the same narrative arc I am trying to achieve with my next record. To hear that arc, you might have to live a day in my shoes, but I hope you can believe me when I say this record affected me in a way very few have. <a class="dead" title="dead link">Here is video from the session</a>.
