I get a lot of questions now about what IR is. I'm still struggling to put it into terms people can understand without a lot of context, so here's something I just thought of:

IR is like if the <a href="http://osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications Foundation</a>  and <a href="http://rhizome.org/">rhizome.org</a> had a kid that played on the same basketball team as the <a class="dead">Media Lab Europe Human Connectedness research group</a>, <a href="http://turbulence.org/">turbulence.org</a>, and <a href="http://altx.com/home.html">altx.com</a>.

...of course there are many more pointers, but these are a good start.
