...aka The Problematic Holiday[^1] ...and some encouraging words for how to process it...

I could preface this video and these links with some personal backstory, but the speaker in this video so perfectly presents what I would want to communicate, and with so much context and nuance, and, unlike myself, comes from a place with the authority to communicate it. The publisher doesn't allow embedding, so actually follow the link to watch it:

**[Randy Woodley -- Another History](https://vimeo.com/526329183)**

Discovered via [Red Letter Christians: Decolonizing Thanksgiving](https://www.redletterchristians.org/decolonizing-thanksgiving/ "Decolonizing Thanksgiving – Red Letter Christians"), a repost from [Watershed](https://watersheddiscipleship.org/2017/11/21/decolonizing-thanksgiving/ "Decolonizing Thanksgiving – Watershed Discipleship"), by which I found my way to [Randy Woodley](https://www.randywoodley.com/ "Randy Woodley")'s website and then this video.

[^1]: Acknowledged: There are other problematic holidays.
