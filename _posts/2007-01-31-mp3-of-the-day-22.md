[Birdless](https://theinnocencemission.bandcamp.com/track/birdless)

> Something will shine in the backyard.  
> Blue lanterns. Or Saint Gerard,  
> Who was lost in the snow.  
>   
> Something will shine on the ground.  
> My Father will bend His ear to the ground.  
>   
> When we are lost in Carlisle,  
> When we are birdless,  
> Flowerless in the spring  
> And we cannot sing.  
>   
> Oh Father John in the driveway,  
> When we walk out he will bless us,  
> With his hands on our heads.  
>   
> All down the sidewalk there are these  
> Chalk ballerinas the neighbours  
> Drew with arms to the sky.  
>   
> When we are lost in Carlisle,  
> When we are birdless,  
> Flowerless in the spring  
> And we cannot sing.  
>   
> Where are we going tomorrow,  
> Where are we going?  
> Oh I can only say we will be found.  
>   
> Something will shine in the backyard.  
> Blue lanterns. Or Saint Gerard.  
> Who was lost in the snow.  

this song is laying cognisant in your coffin, the love of your life kissing
your cold lips one more time. funny, you hadn't seen her in years.
