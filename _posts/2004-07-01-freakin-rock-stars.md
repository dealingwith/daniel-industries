Freakin' Hott cover article in this week's City Link.

> If you just laugh, the joke's on you.
> 
> These disparate influences come together to build a dark vision of a world where sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll violently combine. In "Old Weird America," the title of which is taken from Greil Marcus' book about Bob Dylan, Gentry writes:
  
>> The people on the ground  
>> Won't react to a sound  
>> Until it's right above them  
>> It's easy to fool the dead  
>> It's easy to give them head  
>> And not really love them

I've got the whole thing saved and will probably archive it here once it's off the City Link site.
