As some of you might remember, I'm slightly obsessed with Miranda July ATM. I bought one of her CD's---I figured I am planning on doing spoken word stuff, so it was also good reference. It is amazing and weird at the same time. I will let you judge for yourself with this the first track of 5 interweaving stories on this record.
