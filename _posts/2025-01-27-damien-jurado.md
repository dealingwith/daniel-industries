I've spent many hours this last week with his latest release [Motorcycle Madness ('25)](https://damienjurado.bandcamp.com/album/motorcycle-madness-25), and his 2021 record [The Monster Who Hated Pennsylvania](https://damienjurado.bandcamp.com/album/the-monster-who-hated-pennsylvania-3), specifically the tracks [Joseph Billy Gwin ('25)](https://damienjurado.bandcamp.com/track/joseph-billy-gwin-25) and [Johnny Caravella](https://damienjurado.bandcamp.com/track/johnny-caravella)[^1] respectively, but I finally clicked on _Live at St. Mark's Cathedral_ because _that cover photograph_ and it has not disappointed.
