Yeah, so [we][3] had a baby, in case you don't follow the twitters, facebooks, or even my boring old website.

Her name is Margot Rose Miller. She arrived promptly on her due date, July 23rd. Since then, we have been even more unable to be on time for _anything_.

Also, you should download all the mp3s <a class="dead">here</a> if you haven't already. Then you have to track down all those artists and buy their new records in full. Because they are all totally worth it.
