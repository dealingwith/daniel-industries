I just published [Desperation Algorithms](/2024/01/15/desperation-algorithms/) and now I've found[^1] this:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IhJmm2t5Hwg?si=V4ypNhBr2a_hbh9n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's [the ending](https://youtu.be/IhJmm2t5Hwg?si=UTRNn_BUg63VrGDF&t=983), really.

> I'm sad. I don't want to leave the 80s. It's just been, like, no notifications and pizza. Uh, yes, please?

There is also [this amazing cut](https://youtu.be/GT_pcn068EY?si=LSnB4DaCLrL1gYM3&t=830) from the almost equally good _I watched all 42 Barbie movies in a row_.

[^1]: The algorithm didn't surface this video, by the way. It surfaced an annoying (but accurate) video about how YouTube Shorts are ruining YouTube, and that video mentioned Liam Thompson.
