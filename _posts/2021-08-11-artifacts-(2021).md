Things found 2 nights before moving house:

- A ticket to a Chester Thompson drum clinic in 1990.
- A poster for a bike race in Germany in 1993.
- A play I wrote in college in 1997.
- Royalty statements from the book I co-wrote in 2002. None totaling more than $50.
- Tax returns back to 2004.

- Margot's death certificate.
- A letter from Southwest Transplant Alliance, letting us know that Margot's kidneys went to a 24-year-old man, her liver to a 1-year-old girl, her heart to a 2-year-old girl.

- Papers from a collective art experience I hosted in 2001(ish). One has printed on it this quote from "Tuesdays with Morrie":

> "Remember the book of Job?"  
> "From the Bible?"  
> "Right. Job is a good man, but God makes him suffer. To test his faith."  
> "I remember."  
> "Takes away everything he has, his house, his money, his family."  
> "His health."  
> "Makes him sick."  
> "To test his faith."  
> "Right. To test his faith. So I'm wondering."  
> "What are you wondering?"  
> "What do you think about that?"  
> Morrie coughs violently, his hands quiver as he drops them to his side. "I think," he says, smiling, "God overdid it."
