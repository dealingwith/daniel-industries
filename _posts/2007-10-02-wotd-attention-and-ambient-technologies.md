[Ambiently](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ambient). Is not really a form of the word. But I just used it in an internal company message. I've posted before about how Twitter is "ambient text" (I did not come up with that) and the idea of web technologies as "ambient technologies" interests me so. I consider Facebook to be closer to the ambient. (MySpace closer to the vomit-on-your-face.) (An interesting comparison situation given they sort-of-kind-of are there to achieve the same thing.) Attention and ambient technologies is a huge thing at the moment as we imagine the future of our industries, societies, and cultures. Are you going to get back to me about that article? It's stewing.
