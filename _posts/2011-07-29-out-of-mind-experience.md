title: "I was able to recognize that what was going on was madness and yet I couldn't stop the waves..."
---

Ezra Caldwell[^1] posted an intimate and important[^2] post that I want to both capture for my future reference and share with you:

> Sitting there on the water I began to talk myself into a state of utter self loathing...An hour later, though, I found myself in a little sleeping cabin apart from the house, curled up in the fetal position completely catatonic. My mind was racing, and none of it good. I couldn't imagine how, for instance, how I was going to be able to get back to NYC. ("Drive the rental car, you fool!" "I can't possibly! I might drive it off the road and kill my wife in a state of self destructive insanity!")...
>  
> From somewhere far back in my head, I watched myself go crazy. There was a part of me in there that found the whole thing fascinating. A part of me that was saying, "Ok Ezra...snap out of it. This is nonsense." Intellectually I was able to recognize that what was going on was madness and yet I couldn't stop the waves of very real emotions that were overwhelming me.
>  
> I had lost *all* confidence. The swagger and cockiness that held me together for the last 3 years simply vanished. I guess I had been waiting for that to happen...I was forced to recognize that without the arrogance, the thing that I really hate about myself, I simply fell apart. (I realize now, that I have about three years of justifiable falling apart to catch up on!)
>  
> Hill had been napping inside, and came out to find me. I couldn't even speak. I managed finally to say, "Baby...I'm in serious trouble."
>  
> Special Ed brought a bottle of bourbon out and helped me talk my way back to earth. I went inside and cooked dinner.

My friend and producer Salim Nourallah has a new record coming out this summer. Be on the lookout for it. This tune crossed my desk about the same time as Ezra's post and seemed to just fit. Had a stressful day today, but it's odd how not-really-stressful "normal" stress is to me now. Intellectually I know that circumstances are stressful, I even see it written across my friends' faces...but my heart is less troubled. The scale [has been re-calibrated after all](/2011/02/28/I-can-not-go-on/).

[^1]: Who you will [remember from previous posts](/2010/10/24/fast-boy/).

[^2]: at least for those who have also experienced traumatic times in their lives; it ties into a lot of things about fear that I have been thinking about lately; about how to deal with the realities of the future given the horrors of the past; about [coping](/2011/02/06/a-black-wave-is-comin/) with whatever that traumatic experience did to one's psychology.
