Thanks all who wrote me. Music does now comfort. Although still not too much. <a class="dead">This song</a> in particular.

M feels a little bit better today. A glimmer.

I do find it funny how providence (or lack thereof?) makes us deists.

Anyway, I have been waiting all day for swm.danielsjourney.com to make the dns rounds, and I still [Update: Still?!? Will have to bug someone tomorrow re this.] can't see it. But it's only going <a class="dead">here</a> anyway.
