We were headed to Tennessee to visit my MIL when she and her husband both came down with covid. We were in Memphis already, so instead of the countryside outside of Chattanooga, we went to Nashville, where the SEC basketball tournament was being held in the following days. I bought tickets to the Arkansas game in the first round (Carissa has become a rabid Arkansas sports fan since Penn began his studies there). We went to the Grand Ole Opry. Plan B turned out to be pretty fun.
