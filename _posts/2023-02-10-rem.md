[Unjustly Maligned, Episode 48, "R.E.M., Early"](https://www.theincomparable.com/ump/48/) (2016)

I only just stumbled across this podcast via [Huffduffer](https://huffduffer.com/). I wouldn't consider R.E.M. ever maligned, but the episode is a fantastic breakdown of their career.

It made me think about my story, _[Funhouse of Music]({{site.url}}/writings/funhouse/)_, in which R.E.M. plays a central role. I re-read it and it still holds up for me. It plays out as a fictional mix-tape for someone actually a bit older than I am, but I genuinely enjoyed picking out the songs represented in the story. I made [a playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO71fV2U3SV2nNEyZ6aIuMCdMNXGw54r5) with (almost) all the songs mentioned in the story--30 in all.
