> Just returned from that temporary autonomous zone, Greenbelt--and feeling somewhat dis(placed)...

> It’s a Gentle place, queasily utopian...

> This is the thing; there are millions of Greenbelts, its a fiction. We all write it and we all read it--and then we write it all over again...This is its TAZness, it negates space and generates place. Whether it’s Castle Ashby, Deene Park, Cheltenham Racecourse, or your head, Greenbelt is weirdly ethereal it has this tent-like quality, it is defined by whoever comes and where it decides to pitch camp, it produces its own space and generates its own unique habitat.

> As it happens, this year the weather and human agency constructed a great festival.
