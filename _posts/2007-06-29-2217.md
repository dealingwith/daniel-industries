> How many times must I shake my bauble and bells  
> And kiss your low forehead, dismal caricature?  
> To strike the target of mystic nature,  
> How many javelins must I waste, O my quiver?
> 
> We shall wear out our souls in subtle schemes  
> And we shall demolish many an armature  
> Before contemplating the glorious Creature  
> For whom a tormenting desire makes our hearts grieve!
> 
> There are some who have never known their Idol  
> And those sculptors, damned and branded with shame,  
> Who are always hammering their brows and their breasts,
> 
> Have but one hope, bizarre and somber Capitol!  
> It is that Death, soaring like a new sun,  
> Will bring to bloom the flowers of their brains!
