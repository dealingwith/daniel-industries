I'm realizing much of the problems with software is that it aims to make complex processes more simple (by which I mean simple-minded), instead of either making complex processes _ridiculously_ simple or making complex processes _easier_.

Case in point is my current focus, content management. Content management and website design and maintenance are very complex tasks. Most tools try to wash those tasks so an average user can accomplish some of them, and the tool takes care of the rest.

Instead, a CMS should be either just a white box OR all the abstract pieces for a developer to construct the white boxes.

Existing paradigms for tool creation only frustrate everyone, instead of solving problems on the heavily populated edges and forcing those few in the middle to choice naivety or mastery.
