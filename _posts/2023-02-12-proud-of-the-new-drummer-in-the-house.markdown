I bought that drum kit in 1998 after graduating from college. I was very deliberate; I knew exactly what I wanted and waited for it to show up; I knew I wanted this to be my forever kit. I still remember the drum guy at the local music store in Florida calling me and telling me, "I think I have your kit," after having shopped there for months and looked at at least a half dozen kits.

I never imagined I would have an 8-year-old son playing it 25 years later.
