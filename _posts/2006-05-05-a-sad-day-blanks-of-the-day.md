_I'm Not Moving On_[^1] ...by ...me ...

because...well...this is a day of starting to move on. don't know how long it will take, how successful we shall be, or if we'll even survive it. but this song shall not be played again. the phone numbers are deleted, the bookmarks too. the photographs are burned to a cdr and put on the bottom of the stack. certain cd's shant be played. they might even be traded in. it's sad. it's the loss of something beautiful. but this is life. we've done this before. and maybe, just maybe, we'll be blessed with something as beautiful again someday.

i've got that intense urge to move again. we've felt this before. but we feel like we've run all over the globe trying to find _that place_ ... _home_ ... all we want is to go home, but we don't have one.

> We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition, when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.

-- Lewis Carroll
