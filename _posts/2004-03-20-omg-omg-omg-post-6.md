> ...i think one of the greatest injustices of the world is that if youre in the bathroom washing your hands, and it smells really bad like booboo, but you didnt doit, then someone walks in and sees you washing your hands and gives you a dirty look like, "you disgusting human, you actually CREATED that smell, ugh!!" cause they think you did it, just really sucks. i really hate that. it happened to me once.
