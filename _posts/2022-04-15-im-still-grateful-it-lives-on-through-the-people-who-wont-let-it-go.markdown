[Static and free](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2016/04/03/static-and-free.html):

> Even though indie blogging has been relegated to third-, fourth-, maybe fifth-class citizen status on the internet in the last few years, I’m still grateful it lives on through the people who won’t let it go. I’ve seen so many talented, passionate bloggers move on to other mediums like podcasting or get sucked into aggregator-ish, socially-charged platforms like Facebook and Medium to chase the high of extra-instant attention, only to find that individual thoughts quickly wash away in a relentless social tsunami that leaves no trace of individual identity or permanence.

> If static sites increase the longevity of indie web writing, that’s just one more reason to support static blogging and the individuals that freely share information that empowers others.
