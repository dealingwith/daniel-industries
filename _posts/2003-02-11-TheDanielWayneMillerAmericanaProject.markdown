All my friends are making records. I've been meaning to make another record since I made the last one 5Â½ years ago. I'm thinking studio time and CD printing is wicked cheap in the Balkans.

(tenative)

1. American Dream Town
2. Just Say Yes
3. Numb Us
4. You Say
5. I Radio Heaven (Over the Rhine)
6. I Really Need a Chorus
7. Comon'
8. The Road that Never Ends 
9. Closed for the Year
10.	Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen)
