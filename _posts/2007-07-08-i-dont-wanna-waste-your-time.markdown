Over the Rhine lyrics from the record _The Trumpet Child_

_I Don't Wanna Waste Your Time_

> I don't wanna waste your time  
> With music you don't need  
> Why should I autograph the book  
> That you won't even read  
>   
> I've got a different scar for every song  
> And blood left still to bleed But I don't wanna waste your time  
> With music you don’t need
>   
> I don't wanna waste good wine  
> If you won't stick around  
> I love to laugh but I'm more than just  
> Your alcoholic clown
> ...  
> Come on lighten up  
> Let me fill your cup  
> I'm just trying to imagine a situation  
> Where we might have a real conversation
>   
> But I don't wanna waste the words  
> That you don't seem to need  
> When it comes to wanting what's real  
> There's no such thing as greed  
> I hope this night puts down deep roots  
> I hope we plant a seed  
> 'Cause I don't wanna waste your time  
> With music you don’t need

_Nothing Is Innocent_

> We'd wake the dead  
> With voices in our head  
> We've gotten used to ignoring the truth
> We close our eyes  
> And breathe and eat the lies  
> That tell us we're so much better than you  
> Silence is loud  
> Humility is so proud  
> Nothing is innocent now

_Entertaining Thoughts_

> The way this works is so mysterious  
> If it gets much worse it's called delirious  
> If I were mad I would be furious  
> But this could be so much more than  
> Just another euphemism for...  
> I've been entertaining thoughts  
> Of what I wanna say to you 
> I've been entertaining thoughts  
> Of what I'm gonna do  
> I've been saving what I got  
> And wondering who to give it to  
> I've been entertaining thoughts all over you  
> You smoke your cigarette  
> And wonder if it's happened yet  
> The heavens slowly part and you ascend  
> I wish that I could say that I'll have no regrets  
> But I may have one or two  
> Or three or four more than you...  
> You will never even know  
> Till it hits you fool  
> Ooh, but I'm entertaining thoughts  
> All over you

_Who'm I Kiddin' But Me_

> Walk into the room with that curious grin  
> Ain't nobody need to know the actual shape I'm in  
> But oh, who'm I kiddin' but me  
> Call you on the phone, I got nothin' to say  
> Put my lips a little closer and stand there anyway  
> 'Cause oh, who'm I kiddin' but me  
> I hang from my desire  
> Like a rope swing from a tree  
> I kick a little higher  
> Singin' I Shall Be Released  
> But oh, who'm I kiddin' but me...  
> The devil's in the details...  
> I'd like to get to know ya  
> And shake the holy fire right out of you  
> But oh, who'm I kiddin' but me
