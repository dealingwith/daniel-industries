> Back in the days when it apparently first appeared in the language, setting out on a journey as potentially perilous as a voyage on the open sea would have been entirely dependent on the weather conditions in and around port. If those conditions are not perfectly suitable -- or rather, not _armogan_ -- then the entire journey would simply have to be postponed or abandoned altogether. In that sense, this is a word to remind us that holding back on taking action is not always a sign of a missed opportunity, but a sign that the time is not yet right. Moreover, not acting when we have the chance by no means implies that the same opportunity -- or perhaps an even more favourable one -- might still come to pass.
