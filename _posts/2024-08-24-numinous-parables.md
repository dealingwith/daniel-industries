> A fellow was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to God for help.
> 
> Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, "Jump in, I can save you."
> 
> The stranded fellow shouted back, "No, it's OK, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me."
> 
> So the rowboat went on.
> 
> Then a motorboat came by. "The fellow in the motorboat shouted, "Jump in, I can save you."
> 
> To this the stranded man said, "No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith."
> 
> So the motorboat went on.
> 
> Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, "Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety."
> 
> To this the stranded man again replied, "No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith."
> 
> So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.
> 
> Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, "I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown. I don't understand why!"
> 
> To this God replied, "I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?"

> Every week Murray goes to the synagogue and prays, "God, please let me win the lottery. Just once, please let me win the lottery."
> 
> This goes on week after week, month after month, "God, please let me win the lottery."
> 
> One day this majestic voice booms down from above, "Murray, meet me halfway, buy a ticket!"

Also first heard from my dad.

I also really like the inverse of those two:

> There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. 
> 
> And the atheist says: "Look, it's not like I don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn't see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out 'Oh, God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard, and I'm gonna die if you don't help me.'" 
> 
> And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. "Well then you must believe now," he says, "After all, here you are, alive." 
> 
> The atheist just rolls his eyes. "No, man, all that was, was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp."
