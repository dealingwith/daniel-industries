[Prayin' For You](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/prayin-for-you)

Guitars, vocals, drums: Daniel Miller  
Bass, keys: Salim Nourallah  
Vocal: Michele Pittenger


Michele came out today and blessed this song with her beautiful pipes, the only remaining touch required for this simple song. At first I couldn't think of any female singers I knew in Dallas. Then I remembered Michele, who I only knew tangentially. Very excited. We had completed everything else last week (as well as most of another song that is still in process, but that Michele also sang on today).

I've been thinking a lot lately about taking people for granted. I was re- listening to [Pete Rollins' talk from Greenbelt last year](https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/talks/the-third-mile/) and this bit stuck out at me. Common sense, but the bit that I took away was to make our relationships with other people religious experiences. To make our understanding and experience of them hyperanonymous. *heheh*

There's more there, but I've got to go and my brain hasn't put all the bits together. Everything is true and nothing is true.
