You've probably read that China has blocked all of blogspot with their nationwide firewall. (Who knows what else you can't get from inside there, too, but I think we can assume it's alot, although this is particularly bad, methinks, since it is a very large number of personal sites that have been blocked...so it is definitely just "all thinking" that is not allowed. Also if you think only China has a nationwide firewall, guess again. Saudi has one too. Who knows who else.

Anyway, <a class="dead">Mr. Beattie has an interesting post</a> about the fact that those firewalls are Cisco. You think only the Gap is guilty or violating human rights? Guess again.

<b>Update:</b> <a class="dead">scripting news</a> has the meta linkage; check it out.
