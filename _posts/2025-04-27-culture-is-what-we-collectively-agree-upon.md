> Culture is what we make it. Culture is what we collectively agree upon. The loudest voices seem to have the most influence: people with fame, wealth, in positions of power, getting media attention and amplification.

> People like us, normal people, might think: I can never be influential like that. I can never be influential enough to matter. 

> The first thought might be true, like that. But the second one is not. You do not need power, or money, or fame, or media, or a big following, or any kind of following to be influential enough to matter. You need only to inhabit the space you inhabit here, now, in this time in which you live. 

> Culture influence happens when one person amasses a lot of reach; one voice gets amplified, cranked up.

> Cultural influence also happens when a lot of people (a mass) each have a little reach. Like, say, the reach from your home to your neighbor’s, from your phone to your friend’s, from your keyboard to your blog. 

> Every small thing you do actually matters.
