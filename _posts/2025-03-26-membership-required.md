What I need you to understand is I don't have time. I don't have time for one more account in my password manager, or another email in my inbox, let alone new emails every day or every week or, if you're nice, only every month. I don't have time to listen to you beg for me to upgrade to Plus, or Pro, or become a Patron, or to keep independent click-clacking alive.

I sympathize with the circumstances you find yourself in, where landlord is the only job category left in the world. But I have reached maximum landlord.
