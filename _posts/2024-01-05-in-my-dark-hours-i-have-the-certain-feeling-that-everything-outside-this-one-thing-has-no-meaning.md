"*I frequently experience moments of nausea in bookstores at the thought of adding one more page to all that fucking print*,"[^2] he said.

"My life sounds like a Penderecki tune," she said.

"I like Penderecki," he said.

"What about Górecki?" she asked.

"Yes, Górecki as well," he replied. "Pärt?", he asked.

"Love," she replied, simply. "*In my dark hours, I have the certain feeling that everything outside this one thing has no meaning. The complex and many-faceted only confuses me, and I must search for unity. What is it, this one thing, and how do I find my way to it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises and everything that is unimportant falls away*."[^3]
