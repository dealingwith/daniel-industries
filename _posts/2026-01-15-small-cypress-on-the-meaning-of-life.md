> ...My prerequisite to thinking love was a reasonable answer to this meaning-of-life business was the realization that I'm part of a greater mystery, which is more of a feeling than a thought I can type into words on my laptop. It's an acceptance I found through sobriety and meditation and pink cloud days that I am part of an ineffable, unanswerable thing that is bigger than me. I am agnostic, I belong to no spiritual tradition, but I feel it and see it when I am of service to others and when I am caught by the web of life and humanity. When the lady at the thrift store keeps my cart from moving while I put the awkward shelf in, the way the light catches dew on a spiderweb, when I see kids falling out laughing at the bus stop. The mystery is hard at work, some people call it awe. Same thing I think...
