[Short & Sweet Portion of Sarah Jaffe's Set at AllGood Cafe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQU5M987Glk)

You could hear a pin drop during Sarah's set. It was incredible.

I'm depressed again today, which sucks, but I have a follow up to my bitch-ass post about local culture written in my head, and it is WAY more positive. And it was being written in said head before this show, but this show was nice proof.
