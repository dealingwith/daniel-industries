Moving was a chance to cull and consolidate my physical library. This is it in its entirety now. I probably got rid of 25% of what I had. I did no organization. Just getting stuff out of boxes and into places they can belong for now.

Most of these I kept because I haven't read them. Some because they are rare. Some because they are important or sentimental. Some because they're reference material. Two because I co-wrote them. One CD is mine. Another has two of my songs on it. The third was the posthumous release from [Carter Albrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Albrecht), which you can't stream anywhere. The black box below the CDs is [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).

These days our bookshelves are mostly digital, and it's a bit of a shame.
