1. Bring your own creamer, half and half, or whatever (unless you drink yours
black).

2. Use **two** of the little prepackaged grinds things. *This is the only-obvious-
once-you-realize-it key*.

3. Enjoy.

Something sweet also improves the experience. my current guilty pleasure
are white chocolate reese's.
