danielsjourney.com is back up, but i still have a lot of things to take care of IRL, so while i'm out of the blogging habit <em>anyway</em>, i'm going to give this site a rest until it is finally ready for prime time. couple weeks or so. although you never know.

my apologies for those who tried to send email in the interim. it was completely broken and hopefully you didn't try more than once after getting your mail returned to you. while all the old email addresses should still/again work, my new email is daniel at integrationresearch.org.

this site is now officially table-free. <a class="dead">long live css</a>.
	
what am i doing IRL u may ask? starting <a class="dead">an organization</a>, developing a semantic web application, and recording an EP. is that enough for you?
