Via [BERG][1]: "John Kestnerâ€™s [Tableau][2] is a nightstand that drops photos
it 'sees' in its Twitter feed into its drawer, to be discovered by its owner."

John Kestner is part of the <a class="dead">Information Ecology team at the MIT Media
Lab</a>, so of course I'm going to gush a bit, but check out [some videos
of his other projects][6].

I'm particarly interested in things like the <a class="dead">Daydar personal productivity
framework</a>.
