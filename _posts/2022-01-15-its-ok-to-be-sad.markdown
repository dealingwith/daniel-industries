How about returning to a seriest of posts I left behind in [2016](https://www.daniel.industries/2016/03/13/when-it-is-not-ok/)? (Yes, this is because I was contemplating my extensive blog [backlog](/2021/01/26/in-defense-of-the-backlog/).) ([Part 1](/2016/02/03/its-ok-to-be-sad-on-the-legitimacy-of-unhappiness/), [Part 2](/2016/02/09/its-ok-to-be-sad-part-2/), [Part 3](/2016/02/17/joy-and-sorrow/), [Part 4](/2016/03/10/on-actual-depression/), [Part 5](/2016/03/13/when-it-is-not-ok/).)

...thus endeth the resurrection of my final notes on the _It's Ok to Be Sad_ series. Perhaps, as we approach two solid years of COVID misery, it was a good time to revisit it.
