Chuck Palahniuk wrote _Fight Club_, _Choke_, _Survivor_, and _Invisible Monsters_. I've seen Fight Club and read Choke. Invisible Monsters is my next read and I'm told it is very non-linear. Just to say, again, that storytelling is moving in this direction. Check him out if you have not already. Amazing stuff.

:: Update: Read Invisible Monsters. Amazing read. Very nonlinear. Very cool. Read it if you dare.
