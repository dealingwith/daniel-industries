!["Lucy tries to bite Milo"](/assets/2022/10/lucy-milo-halloween-pasadena.gif)

I've had this sitting around my cloud drive storage for a long time, and this morning was cleaning out said storage. Obviously, it is from halloween. I think it must have been from the last halloween at our old house, which would have been 2020.

I love this gif so much and I'm not sure why. I love the dynamic between my children. It makes my heart full when I see them interact like this, even when one of them is getting annoyed with the other. ðŸ˜„
