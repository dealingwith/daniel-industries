Last weekend Milo and I [rode the Bike the Bluebonnets bike rally](https://www.strava.com/activities/14157638380) in Ferris, TX for the third time. We did the 37-mile loop for the first time after doing the 20-something-mile loop the previous years. He gets a lot of attention from the other riders on the route. He's likely the only kid in the front half or doing a longer route. He's definitely the only one with drop bars and full kit and a sweet [La Vie Claire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Vie_Claire) cap.

Today [we rode just around the lake](https://www.strava.com/activities/14224633555) but we averaged 16+mph on our way back down the lake (unaided by tailwind, I think). He just sat on my wheel without issue, his best time on that segment for sure. The best part of the ride was when we saw a friend who coaches a local high school mountain bike team and stopped to chat for a while. When he saw Milo's bike he said, "You put drop bars on a [Jett](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/jett-24/p/186958)?!" Yes, yes we did. And clipless pedals. ðŸ˜„
