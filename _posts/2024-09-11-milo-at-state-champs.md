Milo raced at the TX state road race championships again this year, the only race of the year with an event for his age group that is a reasonable distance from Dallas. It is still a 2.5 hour drive and a night in a hotel. The race starts at 7:30 am in the middle of Fort Cavazos. We have to drive our kids 12 miles out onto the race course, drop them off, and then drive back to the finish line and wait.

Last year he finished 3rd, this year 5th, but he went much faster, the field was just that much stronger this year. The size of these kids (9-14 year-olds starting together, but separated into two age groups for results) and the quality of bikes they're riding are...intimidating. He was the smallest in the field and the only one on 24" wheels. Last year he was the only one with flat bars, but this year we converted his bike to drop bars. Still on 36mm gravel tires, though, with V-brakes. I started shopping for a better bike the day we got home. Hard to find something small enough, though.

This year his mother and sister came with us, which made it all a lot more fun. Photos by his mother, of course.
