[Future of Coding 76 -- Computing Machinery and Intelligence by Alan Turing](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/076.html)

I consistently love the Future of Coding podcast[^1] and finally got through their latest episode over the weekend. Towards the end, I thought, "I should try to get in touch with Nathan about this." [Nathan Ensmenger](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/nensmeng/) is my godparents' son-in-law, and a <abbr title="His research focuses on the social and cultural history of software and software workers, the history of artificial intelligence, and questions of gender and identity in computer programming.">professor of computer science history at Indiana</abbr>. About one minute later, they name-drop him and mention a paper of his, _[Is chess the drosophila of artificial intelligence?](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/nensmeng/files/Ensmenger2012-Chess.pdf)_, which I now have somewhere in my very long queue but have not yet read.

[^1]: see [my 2023 year-in-review recommendations](/2024/01/06/2023-in-review/#podcasts "Even if you’re not into computers or making stuff with computers, this is an excellent listen. I am into those things, and I do not understand half of what they’re talking about, and it is still wildly entertaining and illuminating.")
