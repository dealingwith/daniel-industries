[Last post](/2023/06/18/reading-on-the-morning-of-fathers-day/) I mentioned the small digital camera I carried around c. 2003. These were two of the first photos I took upon arrival at our apartment in central Sarajevo that summer. The first is a hand-stitched panorama from the apartment's front window. The second is from a back window. Those are bullet holes from the siege snipers.

Today I discovered Pádraig Ó Tuama has records on bandcamp and immediately bought 2 copies of [_Sorry for your troubles_](https://padraigotuama.bandcamp.com/album/sorry-for-your-troubles) (one for myself and one for a friend). I think I first heard Pádraig's work at the Greenbelt festival during an [Ikon](https://ikonbelfast.wordpress.com/) service there in the early 00s.
