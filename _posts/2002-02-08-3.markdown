> Entering Vaux always feels like finding a private nightclub. I follow the taped-up signs and slide in off the street through a door open just a crack. Inside, the usual happy throng and red lights...until I turn round. Above the door by which I entered, in foot-high letters: God is found in the shit. Welcome to Vaux's "season of dirt".
