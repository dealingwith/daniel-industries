Shortly before leaving for Sarajevo [I got an email from a friend of Bill Carter](/2003/04/26/Love-Mail/), and about one day before departing got an email from Bill himself. They had found me via [a blog post I had written about his film](/2003/01/09/Bill-Carter-Miss-Sarajevo/), _Miss Sarajevo_. Because I was a musician, he cautiously gave me contact information for his best friend in Sarajevo, a blues musician who was featured in the film. Like as with most of the Bosnians I met there, I was welcomed with weary smiles, drinks, and smokes. It was the perfect introduction, however, and allowed me instant access to the music scene there. Sarajevo is such a small town, it is easy to meet people and nearly impossible to understand them or get them to open up. Old habits, especially those developed during wartime, are hard to overcome.
