### Preface 02

### 01

My [about](/about "newly slightly updated!") page describes this blog's subject matter as _links, journals, or longer posts about philosophy, bicycling, music, or the internet_, and sure, some of those last four will overlap, like [a description of emerging from darkness as the turning of a bicycle](/2011/01/09/corner/ "It is starting to feel like the first beats of that cadence.")[^1], but there is so much missing in that simple picture sketched for a new arrival.

The main subject of this blog is grief. Grieving my first daughter, lost relationships, my health. Grief at being born into such a troubled world, grasping for _meaning_ but finding only absurdity, more often separated from _beauty_ than experiencing it, trying to craft _stories_ but losing the plot. And yet _seeking_ and fighting all along the way.

### 02

This question of how this is all connected made me wonder if there was some way to determine or see how connected all this work is. Many of these posts have category tags. I asked the robot for a way to visualize when and in what volume those tags intersect. It went in a different direction than what I had in mind, but it was interesting so I spent some time following it through to some state of completion: [a graph view of the categories in this blog](/category-map).

In terms of understanding the interconnectedness of posts here, it's more or less a failure. What is immediately clear:

1. I was better about categorizing early on, or at least before switching to Jekyll and posting less frequently. This makes short-but-frequent post types from the first decade take up more space in the graph.
1. Most of my posts here are links to other things _elsewhere_. Fair: that's the nature of this blog. It's old-school like that.
1. I still have a lot of work to do as it relates to cleaning up my category metadata and making it useful, the interconnectedness isn't represented in the metadata.[^2]

### 03

That's probably because while I know there are through-lines here like grief, I don't even know what they all are. Today was my second time attending the Homebrew Website Club (I mentioned the last one in [last month's Indieweb Carnival post!](/2026/01/17/indieweb-carnival-the-meaning-of-life/#ps)), and this topic came up, and I confessed this fact. I also confessed to being more drawn to questions than answers. I mentioned my post about [ambiguous work](/2025/11/05/ambiguous-work/). I complimented Tracy Durnell on her [Big Questions](https://tracydurnell.com/questions/) framework.

I thought about, but did not mention, Over the Rhine's track _Nobody Number One_[^3], a song with smokily-spoken verses, the last of which ends with:

> _You need questions_  
> _Forget about the answers_  
> Do you really wanna die this way?
>
> That's the trouble with you and me  
> We always hit the bottom before we get set free  
> I'm so far down  
> I'm beginning to breathe  

It has kind of felt like I'm always hitting bottom. I'm reminded of the famous Leonard Cohen song [I've quoted here before](/2024/08/21/hopefulness-can-often-feel-like-the-most-indefensible-and-lonely-place-on-earth/ "'Suzanne'. It's Suzanne."), when a certain late-night talk show host pointed them out:

> And Jesus was a sailor  
> when he walked upon the water  
> And he spent a long time watching  
> from his lonely wooden tower  
> _And when he knew for certain_  
> _only drowning men could see him_  
> _He said all men will be sailors then_  
> until the sea shall free them

To which Nick Cave responds:

> It is the devastation that turns us from being a half-formed person into a fully formed or fully realized human being.

How all this relates to [connection](/2026/01/17/indieweb-carnival-the-meaning-of-life/) and [the Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)) and the [wholly Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numinous#Rudolf_Otto) is probably another through-line. In the meantime I'll listen to Cave's latest, _Wild God_.

### 04

While Cave is interrogating in the abstract, I'm drawn back to Andy Shauf, who puts short films in every song.[^4]

If I were true to this horrible, lonely path, I'd be documenting these scenes too. I wish I could do it as beautifully as he does.

> A ﬁre truck goes screaming by and it reminds me of that night when you said that you were coming home, then I waited up till four in the morning. She says, “I remember, and why the fuck would this be a good time to bring that up?” And I am silent, because I’m not sure. Sometimes I feel like I should never speak again. She takes my hand and says, “C’mon you know this one’s my favourite song.”
> 
> And I can see it in my mind, those flames reaching so high into the night, and that poor family standing on the front lawn watching. And for some reason, I remember that feeling being almost jealousy for a new beginning, but I should have known that I was already burning it to the ground. Now that I’m dancing in the ashes, I just want it to be whole.

[^1]: Of course, now that turning a bicycle has brought a new, different [season of darkness](/2026/01/10/how-to-horribly-end-a-year/), the irony rings loudly.
[^2]:  It may never be, and there are probably better methods for finding the threads here. That's been part of my [lifelong pursuit](/2017/12/23/swim-stock-take/) of [PIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management) technologies.
[^3]: Off the record _[Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Over_the_Rhine_album))_, released in 2003, right at the start of the dissolution of my first marriage, while I fell backwards cinematically into a black hole of lonely isolation, stuck in Sarajevo, holding onto this music with all my strength.
[^4]: OMG, the _Over the Rhine_ record before the one referenced here was titled _Films for Radio_. I have even [covered _I Radio Heaven_](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/i-radio-heaven "One of the few tracks of mine I'm actually proud of if I EQ it just right. It helps I didn't write the song. And love it so much.") from that one. I really do turn into Charlie from _Always Sunny_ every post.
