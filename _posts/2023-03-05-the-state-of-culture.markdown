[The State of the Culture (2023)](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/the-state-of-the-culture-2023)

The above article contains great sentiment, but we've been saying this, in almost exactly the same way, since at least 2001.

I went hunting through my blog for all the posts I've made basically saying the same thing. After all, I founded Integration Research in 2003 to explore these very same concepts. I couldn't find a specific post that said the exact same thing, because it is one of the constant themes of this entire blog. For example [this 2016 post describing what we were working on in 2003]({{site.url}}/2016/03/15/goodbye-integration-research/):

And new platforms have emerged: YouTube is the dominant cultural platform of the present day. Leanpub and similar online publishing tools are better than anything I ever dreamed up.
