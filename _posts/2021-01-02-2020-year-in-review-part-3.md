**The Job**

[I covered this one pretty well in this post about Epic React]({{site.url}}/2020/09/29/epic-react/).

> earlier in the year I was approached to join egghead. Iâ€™ve known Joel for over a decade and I was chuffed to potentially have an opportunity to work with him again. In June that opportunity became reality.

[That opportunity was also the reason for the trip to Portland]({{site.url}}/2020/03/03/weekend-in-portland/).

Having taken my previous company "across the finish line" so to speak, and not constrained by any buy-out or retention package, I was free to take a great opportunity to work with a friend in an industry (developer education) that I'm really interested in. It also allowed me to get back to a small company, which is my preference.

I again get to work with truly great people, for whom I am grateful.

The challenges are considerable, as they are with any small or mid-sized business. That's what makes it interesting and all worth it.
