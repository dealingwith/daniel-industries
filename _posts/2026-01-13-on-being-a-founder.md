I wrote this in 2019 on a semi-private writing community site I was part of at the time. It just randomly surfaced in my notes, I can't even remember how now. I have performed some light edits here.

Starting something is easy. Leading something small that may or may not succeed is relatively easy. Leading something that is successful is difficult. Leading something that is successful and long-lived is very difficult.

Being the founder of a successful company is terrifying. Success can often feel arbitrary and tenuous. The financials of your organization may be unsteady, unpredictable or near-collapse at times.

As a founder of a successful company, your organization is probably the single biggest outward validation of your self-worth. You’ve invested more time and energy into this endeavor than probably anything else you’ve ever done. It is an embodiment of your values. If it fails, you fail.

Every day is a constellation of anxiety. Every day is a rollercoaster of successes and failures. Every day requires you to learn something new. Every day is an opportunity for your imposter syndrome to flourish.

Try not to fall prey to these dangers. Be on the lookout for their symptoms. Try to get enough sleep. Try not to be paranoid. Look for strength from somewhere outside of yourself. Find mentors, peers, spiritual advisors.

Believe in those that work for you. You hired them because they are smart and capable. They want this to succeed just as much as you do.

Believe in your vision. Do not be swayed. All your work should be in service to that vision. Adjust, but do not swerve. You serve your customers, but they are not your master.

Sit in silence with your feelings. Choose your words carefully. Lead with your heart, and keep your heart pure.

> ...there’s consistently been this dilemma in organizations I’ve been a part of, where leaders want their staff to think more strategically—or even just more tactically—but said staff is far too busy just trying to keep up with the ambitious plans of said leaders to take time to think. This often applies even at the highest level of an organization, where even directors, vice presidents, and CEOs have their time fully allocated to meetings and batting away emails and Slack messages.
