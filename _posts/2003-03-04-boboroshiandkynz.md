<a class="dead">boboroshi and kynz</a> are an ambient/electronic outfit, one-half of which is my friend John Athayde. I've been listening to their mp3's for over 30 minutes so far, and still have over 30 minutes left--and that's just what they have for free <a class="dead">on their website</a>! At any rate--highly recommended! Really good...I'm jealously impressed! I've been meaning to put together a project like this for some time and it just has never materialized...of course <a class="dead">John</a> in his prolificness is on it. All my electronic-music peps in the UK, you want to check this out, every tune...
