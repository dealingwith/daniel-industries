title: "To Find an Alternative to WordPress, Just Go Back to the Beginning"
excerpt: "A French developer can create a CMS, abandon it, and move on to a humble career in software, and a college student in Houston can fork that CMS, convince another software developer to help him continue the project, turn that into a rather profitable business, and become a wealthy and (until very recently) well-regarded internet person."

WordPress-the-company has found itself in some hot water lately, mostly due to the actions of its founder. This post is not about said water, but [here is a link I found that describes the "double-whammy" and the conundrum many WordPress customers and/or users find themselves in](https://tedium.co/2024/02/28/wordpress-automattic-tumblr-controversy/). WordPress has long been a reliable organization, seemingly both by design (by which I mean the [.com](https://wordpress.com/)/[.org](https://wordpress.org/) divisions) and by virtue of the sanity of its leadership. The latter is now in question. I do not find this circumstance surprising, nor potentially irredeemable. However, I saw some toots on Mastodon discussing options for moving off WordPress, which got me thinking...

You could go back to the original trunk from which WordPress was forked in 2003. What _was_ that thing called? I was there, paying attention at the time, but I still had to look it up: [b2/cafelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#History). 

This part of the nature of open-source software is one of its most interesting. A French developer can create a CMS, abandon it, and move on to a humble career in software, and a college student in Houston can fork that CMS, convince another software developer to help him continue the project, turn that into a rather profitable business, and become a wealthy and (until very recently) well-regarded internet person. In the meantime, another French developer can also [fork the original CMS](http://b2evolution.net/), maintain it for almost two decades in a (relative to WordPress) quiet corner of the internet, and [eventually move on to other things](https://fplanque.com/dev/b2evolution/18-years-of-b2evolution/).

03/01/2024 Update: the original [cafelog.com](https://cafelog.com/) site is still up, however few, if any, of the links on it work. There is also a historical (but not officially archived) [b2 repo on Github](https://github.com/leogopal/b2). There is also an [entire book about WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/book) on Github; see [2-b2-cafelog.md](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/trunk/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md). It would seem many of the links in the book are broken; one working link is to this [2011 talk by Michel Valdrighi](https://wordpress.tv/2012/02/27/les-origines-de-wordpress-la-naissance-de-b2cafelog/) at _WordCamp Paris 2011_, however the video is no longer accessible.

There was another CMS launched in 2003, one designed and developed by [one of the early internet renaissance humans](/2018/01/21/dean-allen/) (who [would leave the project just a few years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textpattern#Developers)). That's right, not only is [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) still available, it is still being actively maintained, and it still uses Textile, which despite [inspiring Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)#History) was (seemingly) entirely supplanted by its descendant. But lo! Textile has [its own website](https://textile-lang.com/) and [was updated just this year](https://github.com/textile). [README.textile](https://github.com/textile/php-textile/blob/master/README.textile)! I didn't know you could DO that! I want to convert all my readme files. This markdown hoodie is threadbare, hand me my textile smoking jacket!

Aside: [Textpattern is on the fedi](https://indieweb.social/@textpattern), on the same server as I am, no less!

I'll wrap this up before I spawn more tabs about Drupal (which has a more recent release than WordPress) or Movable Type (yes, version 8 dropped last November). Perhaps I should check out the _Adobe ColdFusion Online Summit 2024_...I did (almost exclusively) code in ColdFusion from mid-2003 until mid-2004. There is one ColdFusion CMS on Wikipedia's [list of content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems). Its [readme.md](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/ContentBox/blob/master/readme.md) contains this gem, which is both ominous and prophetic:

> Because of God's grace, this project exists. If you don't like this, then don't read it, its not for you.

If there is better evidence of God's grace than a bunch of [jiggling atoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA4odJfINkE) combining to create software over the course of decades, I can't think of one right now.
