This site is built using the [Jekyll Ruby-based static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) and has been for the last decade or so. Prior to that, many Content Management Systems were used, including a home-spun PHP-based CMS called [SWIM](/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/). It started its life in 2001 on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/).

It is built on my personal computer, a MiniForums desktop running PopOS.

It is written in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I typically use the [Ayu Mirage](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu#mirage) theme but sometimes switch to [Github Light](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme). [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is used to manipulate images, when necessary. It is deplyed via rsync from the terminal. I use Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), with the [Oh My Zsh git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) getting heavy use. Source code is managed via git and GitHub. The font used in both VSCode and the terminal is [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig).

Post ideas are stored and managed in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Words are typed on either a [MagicForce 82](https://drop.com/buy/magicforce-82-key-mechanical-keyboard) with Gateron Brown switches or a [Razor BlackWidow Tenkeyless](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-blackwidow-v3-tenkeyless) with Razor's Orange switches. Words are viewed on a Dell UltraSharp 4k LCD monitor. Things are pointed and clicked on with a Logitech MX Master mouse.
