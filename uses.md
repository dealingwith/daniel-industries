This site is built using the [Jekyll Ruby-based static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) and has been for the last decade or so. Prior to that, many Content Management Systems were used, including a home-spun PHP-based CMS called [SWIM](https://daniel.industries/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/). It started its life in 2001 on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/).

It is most often built on a 2021 MacBook Pro generously provided by my place of work. It is also built on my personal computer, a Dell XPS 17 running Ubuntu 21.10.

It is written in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I typically use the [Ayu Mirage](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu#mirage) theme but sometimes switch to [Github Light](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme). Only default image manipulation applications are used on both macOS and Ubuntu. It is deplyed via rsync in either iTerm2, macOS Terminal, or GNOME Terminal. On macOS, I use Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), with the [Oh My Zsh git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) getting heavy use. Source code is managed via git and GitHub.

Post ideas are stored and managed in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Words are typed on either a [MagicForce 82](https://drop.com/buy/magicforce-82-key-mechanical-keyboard) with Gateron Brown switches or a [Razor BlackWidow Tenkeyless](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-blackwidow-v3-tenkeyless) with Razor's Orange switches. Words are viewed on a Dell UltraSharp 4k LCD monitor. Things are pointed and clicked on with a Logitech MX Master mouse.
